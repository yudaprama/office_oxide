# Contributing to office_oxide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## The rules that matter most

These apply to **everyone, including the maintainer** — office_oxide is a
correctness-critical parser, and a subtle regression can silently corrupt output
for many documents.

1. **Open or find an accepted issue before non-trivial work**, and agree the
   approach there first. **Drive-by pull requests with no linked, accepted issue
   may be closed without detailed review.** Bug/typo/docs fixes are exempt.
2. **Any change to parsing, extraction, or the document IR must be proven not to
   regress on real Office files.** These paths are heuristic and fail silently.
   Ship a minimal synthetic reproducer (in code) for every bug fix, and run your
   **own** corpus of real `.docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.doc/.xls/.ppt` (the project corpus
   is private, not distributed) — report what you tested in the PR, vs both
   `main` and the latest release.

### Contribution quality & AI-assisted work
Maintainer review time is the scarcest resource — a contribution must be worth
more than the time it takes to review it. We are not anti-AI; we are anti-slop.
- **You are responsible for everything you submit**, including code an AI wrote —
  licence, correctness, provenance. You must be able to **explain every line**.
- **Write issues, PR descriptions, and replies yourself.** Autonomous agents must
  not open issues/PRs; such PRs may be closed. **Disclose AI assistance** (tool +
  extent). We do not accept fully or predominantly AI-generated PRs.
- **No third-party/customer documents committed as fixtures** — build minimal
  synthetic ones in code. Name tests by defect class, not issue/PR number.
- **Fill in the templates.** Issues and PRs opened without filling in their
  template are **closed automatically** (edit + reopen). Maintainers, drafts, and
  `skip-template-check` are exempt.

## Where Help Is Wanted

Individual issues come and go; these areas are durably open. Pick one, then open an
issue describing what you intend to do **before** writing non-trivial code — see
[the rules that matter most](#the-rules-that-matter-most).

| Area | What it looks like | Extra bar for this area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Legacy binary formats** (`src/doc/`, `src/xls/`, `src/ppt/`) | Structures the parsers don't read yet — outline levels, fields, embedded objects, legacy code-page decode. Every claim traced to the MS-DOC / MS-XLS / MS-PPT spec section it comes from. | A **real** file that exercises the new path, not only a synthetic one. A parser change whose new branches are reached by no real document is not yet proven. |
| **IR and renderers** (`src/ir.rs`, `src/ir_render.rs`) | Fidelity gaps in `plain_text` / `markdown` / `html` — spacing, nesting, list numbering, table shape. | Before/after output for the affected documents, and confirmation the other two renderers didn't shift. |
| **Binding parity** (`go/`, `js/`, `csharp/`, `src/wasm.rs`) | The Python surface leads and the others lag. Closing one specific gap is a well-scoped task. | An example under `examples/<lang>/` plus a test in that binding's CI job. |
| **Robustness** | Malformed, truncated or hostile files must return an error — never panic, hang, or allocate unboundedly. | A synthetic malformed input as a test, and a statement that it fails before your fix. |
| **Docs and examples** (`docs/`, `examples/`) | Getting-started guides, per-language examples, corrections. | Exempt from the accepted-issue rule — just open the PR. |

Smaller entry points are labelled
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/labels/good%20first%20issue)
and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/labels/help%20wanted).
They are applied sparingly, so an empty list is normal rather than a sign that
nothing needs doing — the table above is the better starting point.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Pick a Task

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues), or pick an
  area from [Where Help Is Wanted](#where-help-is-wanted).
- Comment on the issue to claim it, and **wait for a maintainer to accept the
  approach** before writing non-trivial code. Work that arrives as a finished pull
  request with no agreed issue may be closed without detailed review, however good
  it is — agreeing the shape first is what protects your time, not just ours.
- No issue that fits? Open one. The
  [Feature Request](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)
  template asks for the problem before the solution; if your work is one step of a
  larger plan, describe the whole plan there so the scope is agreed once.

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test additions
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### 3. Make Changes

Write code following our [Coding Standards](#coding-standards).

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a specific module (all in the same crate)
cargo test docx::

# Run with features
cargo test --features python

# Build and verify examples
cargo build --examples

# Watch mode (auto-reload)
cargo watch -x test
```

### 5. Format and Lint

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Or use the Makefile
make check-all
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat(xlsx): expand shared formulas on read"
git commit -m "fix(doc): correct code-page decode for legacy text runs"
git commit -m "docs: document the DocumentIR table model"
```

Commit types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 7. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Coding Standards

### Rust

#### Style

- Follow [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `rustfmt` (configured in `rustfmt.toml`)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation

#### Naming Conventions

```rust
// Modules and crates
mod document_parser;

// Types (structs, enums, traits)
struct DocxDocument;
enum DocumentFormat;
trait Extractable;

// Functions and methods
fn parse_document() -> Result<Document>;

// Constants
const MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH: usize = 100;
```

#### Error Handling

```rust
// Use Result<T> for fallible operations
pub fn open(path: &Path) -> Result<Document> {
    let file = File::open(path)?;
    let doc = parse_file(file)?;
    Ok(doc)
}

// Avoid unwrap() in library code (only in tests and examples)
```

#### Safety

- Avoid `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary
- Document all `unsafe` blocks with safety invariants
- Prefer safe abstractions from the standard library

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use `ruff` for formatting and linting
- Type hints for all public functions
- Docstrings in Google style

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Build the input **in code**. No third-party or customer document is committed as
a fixture, so tests construct the bytes they need and parse them from memory:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::io::Cursor;

    #[test]
    fn test_heading_style_becomes_a_heading() {
        let bytes = build_minimal_docx(/* the one construct under test */);
        let doc = Document::from_reader(Cursor::new(bytes), DocumentFormat::Docx).unwrap();
        assert!(doc.plain_text().contains("Hello"));
    }
}
```

Name the test after the **defect class** it guards
(`test_heading_style_becomes_a_heading`), not after an issue or PR number.
Every test function starts with `test_` — a test is the one kind of function
nothing ever calls by name, so the prefix is what marks it as one in a diff or
a grep. CI enforces this, along with "no `allow(dead_code)`" and "no ticket
numbers in code or comments", via `scripts/house-rules-check.sh`; run it
locally before pushing.

#### File naming

Every file in `tests/` is named `test_<area>.rs` — `test_docx_integration.rs`,
`test_robustness_and_safety.rs`. The prefix makes test files sort together and
makes it unambiguous, in a diff or a grep, that a file is a test rather than a
fixture or a helper.

The one exception is `tests/common/`, which holds shared builders rather than
tests; Cargo would otherwise compile it as its own test binary.

Tests in the other bindings keep their own ecosystem's convention, which is
mandatory or idiomatic there and not ours to override: `*_test.go` (Go
requires it), `*.test.mjs` (Node), `*Tests.cs` (.NET).

Ready-made builders already exist — reuse them rather than writing another:

- `tests/common/mod.rs` — a synthetic `.doc` writer (`build_doc`, `open_doc`,
  `prose_grpprl`, `row_grpprl`, `cell_grpprl`) that emits a real CFB/OLE2 container.
- `tests/test_docx_integration.rs` — `DocxBuilder`, which assembles a minimal OPC
  package part by part.

### Integration Tests

Located in each crate's `tests/` directory.

### Coverage Goals

- **Library code**: 85%+ coverage (enforced in CI)
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage (parsing, error handling)

Check coverage:
```bash
cargo llvm-cov --lib --tests --html
open target/llvm-cov/html/index.html
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- All public items must have doc comments
- Include examples in doc comments
- Run `cargo doc --no-deps` to check rendered docs

### Examples

```rust
use office_oxide::Document;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let doc = Document::open("report.docx")?;
    println!("{}", doc.plain_text());
    Ok(())
}
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)

### Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR
2. Address feedback and push updates
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged
4. Your changes will appear in the next release

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All commits must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer certifying that you wrote the code and have the right to contribute it under the project's MIT OR Apache-2.0 license. Add it with:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(docx): add heading extraction"
# Produces: Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Sign-off (`-s`) certifies your right to contribute. A strict DCO CI check is currently disabled for this repo; the **CLA check** (below) is the enforced gate on pull requests.

**CLA** — non-trivial contributions are also accepted under the project's [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md). It is a *licence, not an assignment*: you keep ownership and grant the project a broad copyright + patent licence including the right to relicense future versions. Trivial changes (typos, formatting, docs) are exempt. Once the CLA bot is enabled it records your one-click sign-off on your first PR; until then the DCO sign-off above is the operative requirement.

## License

By contributing, you agree that the **outbound licence for released code is MIT OR Apache-2.0** (inbound = outbound for what ships to users). In addition, **non-trivial contributions are made under the project's [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md)**, which grants the Maintainer a broader, sub-licensable copyright and patent licence so the project can relicense *future* versions if needed. The CLA does not change the licence of any already-published release. Trivial changes are exempt and remain inbound = outbound only.

This means:
- Your code will be available under permissive open-source licenses
- Users can choose either MIT or Apache-2.0 for their needs
- See [LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) and [LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) for full terms
