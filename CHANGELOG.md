## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.12] - 2026-09-21

> Read-path fidelity across all six formats, and the first real fidelity work on the legacy binaries. 141 issues closed, every dependency at its latest release, and a corpus verification that compares against independent readers, not just the previous version.
>
> The legacy `.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt` readers went from "extracts the text" to structured: per-note footnotes, endnotes, comments and headers/footers in `.doc`; character and paragraph formatting from CHPX/PAPX; list identity via `PlfLst`/`PlfLfo`; `.ppt` direct formatting, master inheritance, hyperlinks, hidden slides, OLE objects and grid-of-shapes tables; `.xls` comments, hyperlinks, data validation, chart text and the 1904 date system. On the OOXML side the recurring shape was *parsed-then-discarded*: the parser had it, a converter or one of the four renderers dropped it — rich-text runs, merged cells, defined names, formula text, speaker-note formatting, OMML equations, SmartArt, embedded charts, shape click actions.
>
> Verified against **10,599 real Office documents** — arm-to-arm with v0.1.11 (5 crashes and 5 timeouts in the baseline, **0** here) and against ten independent readers, which is how the largest content-loss defect in the crate's history (80 `.xls` files at 2–58 % of every reference) was found and fixed *before* this shipped.

### Verified

Two passes over `~/projects/office_oxide_tests/` — **10,599 real Office documents**, all six formats plus their macro/template/strict/encrypted variants, 38 sources.

**Pass 1 — release regression sweep, after every dependency was bumped.** v0.1.11 and this branch, each over every file on four surfaces (`text`, `markdown`, `html`, `ir`) — 42,396 observations per arm, compared on status, on word multisets with split/join awareness (a `\w+` tokenizer misreads restored entities as loss), and on timing, using `scripts/regression-sweep/sweep_tree.py` + `compare_tree.py`.

| | v0.1.11 | 0.1.12 |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` observations | 40,202 | **40,716** |
| crashes (SIGKILL/abort) | 5 | **0** |
| timeouts (120 s) | 5 | **0** |
| `err` | 2,184 | 1,680 |

Every `ok → err` (20 files) replaced a 0-byte "success": 7 encrypted `.pptx` now say so ([#296](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/296), [#320](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/320)), 12 `.ppt` files with no readable PowerPoint stream (PowerPoint 4.0/95-only files and fuzzer artefacts) now say so ([#351](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/351)), and POI's own duplicate-entry `.xlsx` is refused rather than silently resolved to one copy. Every `err → ok` (146 files) is a macro-enabled or template extension that used to be rejected ([#282](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/282)). The sweep's first run was *not* clean — it found the `ir` memory regression ([#349](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/349)), the TOC-entries regression ([#350](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/350)) and two smaller ones ([#355](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/355), [#356](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/356)) that this release had introduced, all fixed before this section was written.

**Pass 2 — quorum check against independent readers.** The same corpus through Apache Tika 3.3.2 (POI), python-docx 1.2.0, pandoc, openpyxl 3.1.5, python-calamine, xlrd 2.0.2, catdoc, antiword, xls2csv and catppt (`scripts/regression-sweep/refpanel.py` + `quorum.py`). A file is flagged when at least two references agree with each other while office_oxide recovers under 70 % of their words. This is the pass a two-arm diff cannot do, and it found the defects present in v0.1.11 too: **80 `.xls` files at 2–58 % of every reference** — one shared-string parsing bug ([#353](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/353)) — plus [#352](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/352), [#357](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/357), [#358](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/358). Flagged files went from 149 to 64; the `.xls` odd-one-out count from 80 to **0**. What remains flagged is explained and deliberate: Word 6.0/95 `.doc` rejected with a clear error (23), hidden text (`w:vanish`, including style-inherited) and tracked deletions the reference tools show and Word does not, `.xlsx` sheet names ([#359](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/359)), and fuzzer artefacts.

**Pass 3 — performance and rendering, after the fixes above.** The same corpus through `perf_sweep.py` on both arms (zero status regressions; every timing flag re-measured serially), the quorum re-run against Tika, the python libraries and the C tools (74 flagged files, every one explained: hidden text and tracked deletions the references show, formulas vs cached values, references that returned nothing, Word 6/95 and `.xlsb`), and a structural comparison of our markdown against pandoc's GFM over the 3,521 `.docx` files, which found the three renderer defects listed under *Fixed*.

**Pass 4 — one harness, one verdict per file** ([#401](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/401)). The passes above became `scripts/regression-sweep/harness.py`: both arms, the reference panel, a write→reread round trip and the markdown-structure comparison over the corpus, reduced to a per-file verdict with a stated decision model — the consensus of references that agree with each other is the expected output; a two-arm loss counts only when the consensus has the words and the new arm does not; an arm that sides with a different reference than the other arm is a policy split, not a regression; `w:vanish` runs and field vocabulary explain a loss on their own. It added two axes a two-arm diff and a reference quorum are both blind to: our own text, markdown and html of one file compared with each other (the *dual-renderer* class), and the words of the original IR against those of the IR read back from what we wrote. Those found the defects under *Fixed* from [#381](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/381) on: every `docx/headers_footers/*` file lost its headers on a round trip, every picture below body level was dropped on write, formulas became constants, `.doc` fast-saved files had their paragraphs re-cut at piece boundaries and their tracked deletions shown on the structured surfaces only, and no markdown renderer escaped document text.

**Test-coverage audit.** Every one of the milestone's 162 issues was mapped to the tests its fix commits added (plus a topic search for the ones committed without a number) and judged against the cases its report enumerates. Gaps found and closed: endnote and comment bodies in `plain_text()`/`to_markdown()` (only footnotes were asserted), the DOCX side of numbered headings, paragraph-style-inherited `w:vanish`, `FORMTEXT` default values, CR-only runs' `xml:space`, `docProps/app.xml` and `has_macros` on PPTX and XLSX and a legacy `_VBA_PROJECT` storage, XLSX `plain_text()` sheet names, and a README-vs-clap consistency test for the CLI section (which found the undocumented `replace --output`). The `has_macros` gap turned out to be a real defect ([#380](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/380)).

Plus: 1,380 library and workspace tests green (`--all-features`), clippy `-D warnings` clean, rustdoc `-D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --check` clean, `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` clean, C# (xUnit runner 4.0) and Node (koffi 3.3.1) suites green, and the `house-rules` gate green.

### Added

- **Word 6.0/95 text** ([#374](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/374)). The family was refused outright while catdoc, antiword, LibreOffice and POI read it. Its own FIB layout, no table stream, one-byte characters in the document's code page (or two-byte units under `fExtChar`, the Macintosh and Far East builds), non-complex and fast-saved files, subdocuments included; 15 of the 17 openable corpus files at 0.90–1.00 recall against catdoc, antiword and Tika. Text only — no paragraph or table structure.
- **Excel Binary Workbooks (`.xlsb`)** ([#375](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/375)). The BIFF12 parts — sheet list, shared strings, number formats and cell formats, every cell and formula-value record, merged ranges — decoded into the same model as `.xlsx`, so every converter and renderer applies; 29 of the 35 openable corpus files at 1.00 recall against python-calamine, the rest differing only in value representation. Cached values only (no formula text); fonts, fills and borders not read.
- **Excel 2.x–4.0 (BIFF2/3/4) worksheets** ([#376](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/376)). The pre-OLE2 record stream — refused by name before — is read as a one-sheet workbook: the version's own cell records, `CODEPAGE` text, formula results via `STRING`; 1.00 recall against xlrd on the corpus files. Number formats are not applied.
- **Legacy `.doc` structure.** Footnotes and endnotes as one IR element each ([#286](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/286)); comments split per comment via `PlcfandTxt`/`PlcfandRef` with authors from `GrpXstAtnOwners` ([#345](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/345), [#298](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/298)); header/footer stories split via `PlcfHdd` ([#285](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/285)); CHPX character formatting and PAP alignment/indent/spacing ([#287](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/287)); list identity through `PlfLst`/`PlfLfo` for `start_number` and ordered/unordered ([#250](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/250)); embedded OLE objects under `ObjectPool` ([#284](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/284)); subdocument bodies in `plain_text()`/`to_markdown()` ([#248](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/248)); `HYPERLINK` field targets with field instructions stripped ([#249](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/249)).
- **Legacy `.ppt` structure.** Direct character/paragraph formatting from `StyleTextPropAtom` ([#254](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/254)); placeholder formatting inherited from the master's `TextMasterStyleAtom` ([#335](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/335)); hyperlinks from `InteractiveInfo`/`ExHyperlink` ([#257](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/257)); grid-of-shapes tables reconstructed as `Element::Table` ([#255](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/255)); hidden slides ([#297](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/297)); header/footer/date text ([#308](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/308)); embedded and linked OLE objects ([#337](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/337)).
- **Legacy `.xls` structure.** Cell comments from `NOTE`/`TXO`/`OBJ` ([#307](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/307)); hyperlinks from `HLINK` ([#306](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/306)); embedded chart text via `SeriesText` ([#246](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/246)); pre-OLE2 BIFF2/3/4 files named instead of failing at the CFB layer ([#227](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/227)) — and, later in this release, read ([#376](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/376)).
- **Across formats.** `Metadata::has_macros` for all six formats ([#283](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/283)); `SummaryInformation` title/author/dates for `.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt` ([#244](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/244)); `docProps/app.xml` read on open ([#245](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/245)); conditional formatting as a new IR type for `.xlsx`/`.xls` ([#252](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/252)); data validation rules ([#275](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/275), [#343](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/343)); defined names reach `to_ir()` ([#251](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/251)); placeholder role (subtitle/date/footer/…) on PPTX and PPT shapes ([#258](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/258)); PPTX placeholder formatting inherited from `<p:txStyles>` ([#291](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/291)).
- **Writers.** Hyperlinks in XLSX and PPTX output — a total, unconditional loss before ([#262](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/262)); speaker-note formatting and list structure carried through read, write and every renderer ([#290](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/290)); table-cell character formatting written and read back from inline rich strings ([#346](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/346)); cell comments written as real comments ([#344](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/344)).
- **Renderers.** `to_html_with()` with base64 image embedding ([#318](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/318)); underline, super/subscript, highlight, colour, font and caps in HTML ([#314](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/314)); `List.start_number` honoured in HTML and markdown ([#315](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/315)); adjacent same-style lists merged ([#317](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/317)).
- `examples/corpus_validate`, the per-step JSONL harness behind the verification above.
- `scripts/house-rules-check.sh` and its CI job: every test function is named `test_*`, no `allow(dead_code)`, no issue numbers in code or comments.

### Fixed

- **DOCX read.** Footnote/endnote/comment bodies in `plain_text()`/`to_markdown()` ([#240](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/240)); footnote/endnote/comment *reference markers* reach `to_ir()`, so a note is anchored to where it was cited ([#241](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/241)); `HYPERLINK` field codes via `w:fldChar`/`w:instrText` and `w:fldSimple` ([#267](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/267)); a hyperlink carrying both `r:id` and `w:anchor` keeps its external target ([#242](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/242)); OMML equation text ([#270](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/270)); WordArt `v:textpath` text ([#274](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/274)); legacy VML `v:imagedata` images ([#268](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/268)); form-field checkbox/dropdown/default state from `w:ffData` ([#276](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/276)); embedded chart title/category/series/data text ([#273](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/273)); SmartArt diagram text ([#271](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/271)); embedded native OOXML packages ([#304](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/304)); OMML equation text and `mc:AlternateContent` ([#272](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/272)); `w:vanish` hidden runs excluded ([#305](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/305)); sdt-wrapped cells/rows kept, tracked-change `cellDel` excluded ([#277](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/277), [#266](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/266)); text box with `prstGeom` no longer double-extracted ([#263](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/263)); interrupted numbered lists keep counting ([#243](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/243)); `<w:startOverride>` read back ([#260](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/260)); numbered headings emitted as `Heading`, not `ListItem` ([#223](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/223)); outline-level headings keep their other paragraph properties, cell `<w:jc>` maps to `text_align`, thematic breaks become `Element::ThematicBreak` ([#215](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/215)); nested-table recursion bounded ([#329](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/329)); the default `to_markdown()` renderer increments ordered-list numbers instead of repeating the start value ([#316](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/316)); `truncated_subtrees()` reports content dropped past the depth bound ([#218](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/218)); malformed `dcterms:created`/`modified` normalised or dropped ([#217](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/217)).
- **DOCX write.** Hyperlink relationships scoped to the part that uses them ([#293](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/293)); `r:id` + `w:anchor` both kept ([#292](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/292)); custom footnote marks round-trip ([#219](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/219)); table caption no longer duplicates each round trip ([#311](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/311)); grid width from `col_span` sums ([#265](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/265)); nested lists share one `numId` across levels but each nested-in-container list gets its own ([#261](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/261), [#339](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/339)); title heading not duplicated ([#338](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/338), [#259](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/259)); tab/CR/LF-only runs get `xml:space="preserve"` ([#294](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/294)); image and font parts get a `Default` content type ([#295](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/295)); pretty-print indentation removed — it was Θ(depth²) memory on the write path ([#220](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/220)); rarely-populated sub-structs boxed to cut per-element memory ([#328](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/328)).
- **XLSX.** Shared-string run-level rich text ([#303](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/303)); inline-string whitespace ([#269](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/269)); inter-run spaces and scatter/bubble points ([#280](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/280), [#281](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/281)); formula text through the IR and renderer ([#279](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/279)); shared-formula follower cells keep their formula text ([#278](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/278)); `plain_text()` includes the chart text `to_markdown()` already had ([#331](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/331)); merged cells reach `to_ir()` ([#235](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/235)); threaded comments preferred over legacy boilerplate ([#301](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/301)); in-cell rich-value images instead of a fabricated `#VALUE!` ([#302](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/302)); date-serial conversion bounded, UTF-16 XML parts decoded ([#225](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/225), [#229](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/229)); accounting negatives, trailing literals and scientific exponents in number formats ([#234](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/234)); a cell keeps its column after a row-spanning merge ([#340](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/340)).
- **XLS.** Embedded chart's nested `EOF` no longer closes the parent sheet ([#237](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/237)); `DATEMODE` 1904 threaded through ([#233](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/233)); declared `CODEPAGE` applied to BIFF5 text ([#309](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/309)); record-parsing budget raised and truncation surfaced ([#236](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/236)); date walk bounded and format overrides honoured ([#225](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/225)); merged cells ([#235](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/235)); hidden and very-hidden sheets are kept and flagged rather than dropped, as XLSX already did ([#231](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/231)).
- **PPTX.** Speaker notes routed to `Section.speaker_notes` ([#238](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/238)); PowerPoint Sections' `p14:sldIdLst` no longer overwrites the slide list ([#228](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/228)); embedded chart text ([#239](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/239)); merged-cell tables rendered as a proper grid ([#289](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/289)); shape click actions and non-text AutoShape alt text reach the IR ([#299](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/299), [#300](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/300)); body/title placeholder content flows instead of being wrapped in a positioned `TextBox` ([#342](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/342)); `TextBox` written as its own positioned shape ([#264](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/264)); table cells and bullet items get real run formatting on write ([#341](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/341)).
- **PPT.** `TextTypeEnum` mapping from 3 upward — title/subtitle were swapped ([#253](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/253)); picture shapes resolve to their own slide via `pib` ([#256](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/256)); multi-paragraph text inside one text atom splits on PPT's bare `\r` delimiter ([#334](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/334)).
- **DOC.** `FibRgLw97` field offsets, shifted one slot for every `.doc` ([#247](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/247)); piece-table/FIB text-length gap surfaced instead of silently truncating ([#230](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/230)); FIB language id applied to compressed-text decoding ([#310](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/310)); deleted revision-mark text filtered out ([#288](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/288)); line-shape heading guess tightened against junk ([#224](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/224)).
- **Container / API.** CFB `find_entry`/`open_stream` resolve only the root storage's direct children ([#226](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/226)); macro-enabled and template extensions accepted ([#282](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/282)); encrypted files give a friendly error from every entry point ([#232](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/232), [#320](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/320), [#319](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/319)); `Element` gets an iterative `Drop`, closing the stack-overflow-on-drop gap ([#218](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/218)); `OfficeArtFBSE`-wrapped BLIPs in a Pictures/Data stream are no longer skipped, which also misaligned every later image index ([#336](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/336)); `with_parse_stack` bounds its in-flight parse threads instead of spawning without limit under concurrent load ([#313](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/313)); the C FFI documents its thread-safety contract for opaque handles ([#312](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/312)).
- **CLI / MCP.** `--version` flag ([#321](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/321)); an empty `replace` find string is rejected instead of inserting the replacement between every character ([#322](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/322)); the `ir` JSON projection carries `Note::marker` and run/paragraph formatting fields, and no longer silently swallows new IR variants ([#332](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/332), [#333](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/333), [#221](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/221)); JSON-RPC batch requests processed and the envelope validated ([#326](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/326), [#327](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/327)).
- **Found by the release regression sweep and quorum check** (v0.1.11 vs this branch over 10,599 files, then office_oxide vs Tika/POI, python-docx, pandoc, openpyxl, python-calamine, xlrd, catdoc, antiword, xls2csv and catppt). Regressions introduced by this release: the CLI's `ir` command built a `serde_json::Value` projection that cost 5–10 GB and OOM kills on large spreadsheets — it now streams the IR's serde form, the same bytes the Python/MCP/C/WASM surfaces emit ([#349](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/349)); fields nested inside another field's *result* (every TOC entry is a `HYPERLINK` field) were hidden along with the instruction text, so a table of contents became blank lines ([#350](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/350)); `plain_text()` for `.doc` picked up the footnote separator/continuation-notice stories ([#355](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/355)); style-inherited `w:vanish` was honoured by `to_html()` but not `plain_text()`/`to_markdown()` ([#356](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/356)). Defects present in v0.1.11 too: `.xls` shared strings cut by a `CONTINUE` boundary were misparsed, so any workbook with more than ~8 KB of unique strings lost most of its text cells — 80 corpus files at 2–58 % of what every reference extracts ([#353](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/353)); an embedded chart's cached series values overwrote the worksheet's own A1:Cn ([#352](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/352)); a text box wrapped in a content control was dropped whole ([#357](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/357)); PowerPoint 95 dual-storage files read the unreadable PPT 95 stream instead of `PP97_DUALSTORAGE/PowerPoint Document` ([#358](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/358)); a `.ppt` without its main stream opened as an empty deck with `Ok` ([#351](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/351)); `.xls`/`.xlsx` cell comments reached `to_ir()`/`to_html()` but not `plain_text()`/`to_markdown()` ([#354](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/354)). A 42 KB `.xls` declaring a 65,536 × 256 grid with four corner cells cost 5.1 GB in `to_ir()` (every empty row kept a 256-cell buffer behind it after its cells were popped) and 50 MB of markdown; now 3 MB and 3 KB ([#361](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/361)). `.xlsx` `plain_text()` names its sheets, as `.xls`, `to_markdown()` and every other spreadsheet reader do ([#359](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/359)); `Sheet::rows` is jagged instead of padded to the declared extent — `open()` on that 42 KB file drops from 392 MB to 12 MB ([#362](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/362)); the slot-leak test is deterministic ([#363](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/363)). Every fix ships a regression test that fails on the previous code.
- **Found by the release harness's cross-surface and round-trip axes** (`harness.py`, pass 4). Write side: every section's headers and footers were referenced from the last `sectPr` only, a section owning headers but no page setup got no `sectPr` at all, and the reader dropped an element-less trailing section — `docx/headers_footers/*` lost every header on a round trip ([#383](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/383)); a picture in a table cell, text box, list item, header, footer or note was skipped by the nested converter, and the reader never loaded pictures from header/footer/notes parts (their `r:id`s resolve against those parts' own rels) ([#384](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/384)); `.xlsx` image alt text was not written and every formula was written as its cached value — or as nothing, without one — now `<f>` plus `<v>` through `CellData::FormulaWithValue` ([#385](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/385)); a section title lifted from a heading that is not the first element rendered twice ([#386](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/386)). Read side: a compound file is read by the document stream it holds, so a workbook saved as `.doc` opens as a spreadsheet ([#387](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/387)); Word for Windows 1.x/2.0 flat files are read ([#388](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/388)); `.doc` paragraphs are cut at paragraph marks with each PAPX/CHPX run intersected with every piece — a fast-saved file's runs are not one CP range, so a paragraph could repeat its neighbour or start nowhere — and tracked deletions are left out of the structured view as they are of the flat text ([#389](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/389)); `.doc` `to_markdown()` renders from the structured view, with headings, lists and tables, and headings are no longer forced bold ([#390](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/390)); legacy `SummaryInformation` strings decode in the set's `PID_CODEPAGE` ([#391](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/391)); every markdown renderer escapes document text and writes a cell's line breaks as `<br>` ([#392](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/392)); `.ppt` soft returns are line breaks on the IR surfaces and the direct surfaces no longer leak `\r`/`\x0B` ([#393](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/393)); `.xlsx` prose-mode rows keep every cell ([#394](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/394)); a spreadsheet or document comment's cell and author reach the IR surfaces. A package with one damaged part no longer fails as a whole: an unreadable header/footer part is skipped with a warning, an unreadable sheet is skipped, named in every renderer's output and in `Metadata::text_truncated` ([#395](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/395)); a `.ppt` title placeholder holding several paragraphs is a heading and paragraphs, not one fused bold heading, and a free text box's paragraphs are not fused either ([#396](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/396)); a content control inside a `.docx` table cell keeps the cell's text, a `.doc` that ends inside a table cell keeps that cell, an `.xlsx` formula whose cached result is empty shows nothing on the IR surfaces as on `plain_text()`, and comments, embedded objects and picture alt text carry one label on every surface (`Comment (Author): …`, `[object]`, `[alt]`) ([#397](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/397)). A `.doc`'s declared title reaches `Metadata::title` only, not the section, and a section title is the whole first heading ([#399](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/399)). An `.xlsx` merge over rows the sheet does not store spans the stored rows it covers, not the rows that follow, and a `.pptx` image with a description but no bytes is written as a description-only shape and read back as the same image ([#398](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/398)). Earlier in the same pass: text after a hard break in the same paragraph reached `plain_text()` but not `to_ir()` ([#381](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/381)); drawings in bordered empty paragraphs, XLSX drawn text, PPTX slide comments and XLS comments on empty sheets each reached one renderer and not another ([#382](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/382)).
- **Found by the markdown-structure comparison against pandoc and the "peers read it, we don't" list** (this release's second verification pass, `render_compare.py` / `unparsed_vs_peers.py`). `to_markdown()` ignored list numbering inherited from the paragraph style — Word's own "List Bullet"/"List Number" — while `to_ir()`/`to_html()` resolved it, so a template with 157 bullet items rendered none ([#377](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/377)); the same renderer dropped bold/italic inherited from paragraph and character styles, and every span inside a table cell ([#378](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/378)); a heading style's own `<w:b/>` no longer renders as `<h1><strong>` / `# **…**` on any surface; a table nested in a one-cell layout frame is rendered in place of the frame on both markdown surfaces instead of being flattened into it — 77 rows where there was 1 ([#379](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/379)). The legacy template, show and add-in extensions (`.dot`, `.pot`, `.pps`, `.xlt`, `.xla`) open like their `.doc`/`.ppt`/`.xls` siblings ([#373](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/373)); a file shorter than a CFB header is reported as "not a compound file"; `office-oxide text f.docx | head` no longer panics on the closed pipe ([#372](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/372)). `Metadata::has_macros` recognises the `vbaProject` relationship type Office actually writes (the `schemas.microsoft.com` one) — it was `false` for every real `.docm`/`.xlsm`/`.pptm`, 0 of 70 corpus files; the earlier test had been built from the crate's own wrong constant ([#380](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/380)).
- Workspace test suite repaired ([#330](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/330)); the crate docs, three binding READMEs, the Rust getting-started guide and the root README stop overclaiming write/edit support for legacy formats and list the full CLI/MCP surface ([#323](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/323), [#324](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/324), [#325](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/325)).

### Performance

The first profiling pass over the corpus: every file on four surfaces with per-process CPU and peak RSS (`scripts/regression-sweep/perf_sweep.py`), synthetic documents that scale one structure at a time to expose superlinear paths (`gen_scaling.py` + `scale_run.py`), `perf` with DWARF call graphs on the outliers, and the same files through the reference readers for a baseline. Eight issues, each fixed with a regression test that fails on the old code — allocation counts from a counting global allocator where a timing assertion would be flaky ([#364](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/364)–[#371](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/371)).

- **Package open was quadratic in the number of parts** ([#364](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/364)). `OpcReader::has_part` and the `read_zip_entry` fallback rescanned the zip's central directory — allocating a normalised copy of every name — on every call, and the XLSX loader probes optional parts per sheet, so each *miss* was a full scan. A name index built once per archive: 8,000 one-cell sheets **56 s → 0.19 s**, 8,000 slides **19.9 s → 0.49 s**, 8,000 header parts 6.6 s → 0.24 s, 8,000 images 4.9 s → 0.22 s.
- **IR JSON no longer spends 17 bytes per image byte** ([#365](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/365)). `Image.data` went out as a pretty-printed number array, one line per byte: a 1.2 MB `.docx` was a 140 MB, 8.3-million-line `ir`. It is base64 now (11 MB, 1.09 s → 0.13 s), on every JSON surface; the old array still deserialises.
- **Attribute reads no longer rescan the tag or allocate** ([#366](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/366), [#368](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/368)). Every `optional_attr_str` re-parsed the attribute list from its start and paid quick-xml's per-call duplicate-check `Vec`, so every `w:val` read was a malloc and a four-attribute border edge cost sixteen attribute parses. One allocation-free pass (`xml::attrs`) under every attribute helper; the worksheet cell loop keeps the reference and type borrowed and parses a numeric `<v>` from the borrowed text. XLSX numeric cells: 3.78 → 0.12 heap allocations each.
- **A DOCX table cell no longer costs 4 KB** ([#367](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/367)). `BlockElement` was 536 bytes (an unboxed `Table`), `RunContent` 224 (an unboxed `DrawingInfo`), and every one-element content `Vec` kept the four slots `push` reserves. Boxed and shrunk: a 128,000-cell table opens in **90 MB instead of 524 MB** and converts to IR in 140 MB instead of 241 MB; an 8,000-row table's `text` 1.05 s → 0.14 s.
- **Compound-file streams are read in runs, not sectors** ([#369](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/369)). `read_chain` allocated, seeked and read once per 512-byte sector of an unbuffered `File` — ~28,000 syscalls for a 14 MB `.doc` — then copied the stream again. Consecutive sectors are fetched with one read each into a buffer reserved once.
- **Pictures decode on first request, not at `open()`** ([#370](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/370)). DOC's `Data` stream, PPT's `Pictures` stream and — byte by byte — XLS's whole Workbook stream were scanned for BLIPs even for `plain_text()`: 10–17 % of a text extraction on picture-heavy files. Lazy now; XLS reads only the `MsoDrawingGroup`/`MsoDrawing` payloads its record walk already passes over, where the format keeps them.
- **XLS grid rows are sized once and numbers format with one allocation** ([#400](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/400)). `build_grid` grew each row cell by cell and `format_commas` allocated three times per value, which made million-cell workbooks 2–4× slower than v0.1.11 on the harness's timing axis; `govdocs1_000032.xls` (29 MB) `text` 1.8 s → 0.46 s.
- **XLS no longer copies every record and every cell's text** ([#371](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/371)). `RecordIter` copied each BIFF record into a `Vec`, `parse_cell_record` returned a `Vec` per cell, and a rendered-text grid held every cell's string at `open()` — a string cell three times over, and the allocator half of a large workbook's runtime. Records borrow the stream, cells append, and text renders on demand (see *Changed*). `text` on the largest corpus workbooks 2–2.5× faster at 40 % less memory.

Corpus totals (CPU over every file that opens, this branch before → after): XLSX **0.41×**, PPT `ir` 0.15×, PPTX `ir` 0.35×, DOC `ir` 0.42×, XLS `text` 0.52×, DOCX 0.7×; the largest DOCX peak RSS 104 → 51 MB. Against the reference readers on the same files office_oxide is now the fastest in the panel: 0.59× calamine's total CPU (1.36× before), 0.51× catppt, 0.49× xls2csv, 0.48× antiword, 0.03× openpyxl, 0.05× pandoc. Each scaling dimension probed is linear (log₂ slope ≤ 1.2 at 8,000–32,000 elements).

### Security

- **Spreadsheets: a per-document text budget bounds shared-string fan-out.** A shared string referenced from every cell is rendered once per cell, and nothing bounded that product: a 110 KB `.xlsx` holding one 1 MB string in 12,000 cells rendered to 393 MB on every surface, and the same string from a million rows would have been 32 GB from a 300 KB file — through every binding and the MCP server. Every XLSX/XLSB renderer, the IR converter and the `.xls` reader (which copies the string into each cell at `open()`) now charge the characters they emit against `office_oxide::limits::max_text_chars()` — 256 Mi by default, the shape of POI's `ZipSecureFile.setMaxTextSize` — and stop with a visible `[output truncated: …]` notice (`.xls` also sets `Metadata::text_truncated`). `set_max_text_chars` raises it for processes that read larger workbooks. The default keeps every genuine workbook in the 10,599-file corpus (the largest renders 181 MB of text) and changed exactly the two proof-of-concept files.
- **XLSX/XLSB: a cell reference past the grid sized the IR table to it.** `CellRef::parse` accepted any run of column letters, so `ZZZZZZ1` was column 321,272,405 and `to_ir()` allocated every table row that wide — a 95 GB allocation abort from a 2 KB `.xlsx`, through every binding and the MCP server. References past `XFD1048576` are refused (the cell takes the implied column), the `.xlsb` reader drops such cells, and the converter caps the grid width regardless. Found by the mutation pass over the new `.xlsb` reader.
- **CFB (`.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt`): a cyclic DIFAT chain hung `Document::open` forever.** The DIFAT walk in `CfbReader::read_fat` was the one chain-follower in the reader without a cycle guard; a 1.5 KB file whose DIFAT sector pointed at itself never returned, with no crash signal for a supervisor to act on. The walk is now bounded by the sectors the file holds and reports `DIFAT chain cycle detected`.
- **CFB: a cyclic directory tree overflowed the stack.** `find_in_tree` recursed along sibling pointers without a visited set; since this release routes `find_entry`/`open_stream` through it (the embedded-object shadowing fix), a malformed directory aborted every legacy open. The search is iterative and visits each entry once.
- **XLSX: the fast-path reader skipped the duplicate-zip-entry refusal** that `OpcReader` applies for DOCX/PPTX (the CVE-2025-31672 shape: a scanner reads one copy of `sheet1.xml`, the consumer renders the other). All three OOXML readers now open their archive through one shared check.

### Changed

- Ticket numbers removed from code comments (they belong here), 40 `allow(dead_code)` suppressions removed with the dead code they hid (including an unreachable 190-line XLSX OPC parser), every test function named `test_*`. Enforced by the new `house-rules` CI job.
- `.research/` review notes are no longer tracked.
- **IR JSON omits fields at their default.** Every `None` and every `false` (and `TableRow::allow_break` at `true`) is left out of the serialized IR on every surface — Python, MCP, C FFI, WASM and the CLI's `ir` — and absent keys deserialize to the same value. A 14 MB `.xls` went from 909 MB to 207 MB of pretty-printed JSON. Consumers that index a key rather than `.get()` it must use the default when it is absent ([#360](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/360)).
- **IR JSON carries image bytes as a base64 string** (`"data": "iVBORw0KGgo…"`) on every surface instead of an array of numbers; both shapes deserialise ([#365](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/365)).
- **`office_oxide::limits`** is new: `max_text_chars()` / `set_max_text_chars()` and `DEFAULT_MAX_TEXT_CHARS` (256 Mi). A spreadsheet whose rendered text exceeds the budget is truncated with a notice on every surface; raise the limit once at startup to read larger workbooks whole.
- **`xls::Sheet::display` is gone; use `Sheet::display_text(row, col)`**, which returns the cell's text as Excel shows it (number formats and dates applied) as a `Cow<str>`, formatted on demand from the new `Sheet::xf` grid and the workbook's shared `NumberFormats`. `CellValue::as_text_cow` is the borrowing form of `as_text` ([#371](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/371)). `docx::BlockElement::Table` and `docx::RunContent::Drawing` hold a `Box` ([#367](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/367)).
- **`xlsx::write::CellData::FormulaWithValue { formula, cached }`** is new (a formula with its last computed value, written as `<f>` plus `<v>`), and `SheetImage` gains `alt_text` with `add_image_with_alt` beside `add_image` ([#385](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/385)). **`doc::DocDocument::to_markdown()` renders from the structured view** — headings, lists, tables, headers/footers and notes — instead of the flat text split into blocks ([#390](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/390)). **Every `to_markdown()` escapes document text** (`\|`, `\<`, `\*`, `\[` …) and writes a table cell's line breaks as `<br>` ([#392](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/392)); a picture's `![alt]` is one line. Comments carry their cell and author on the IR surfaces (`A1 (Jane): …`).
- **`.xlsx` `plain_text()` starts each sheet with its name**, like `.xls` and `to_markdown()` ([#359](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/359)). `xls::Sheet::rows` is jagged — index with `.get()` ([#362](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/362)).
- **quick-xml 0.41 → 0.42** — the parser's names, attributes and text events are now `&str`; invalid UTF-8 in an XML part is replaced by U+FFFD (with a warning) rather than failing the part, since 0.42 validates UTF-8 per event.
- Every other dependency and pinned GitHub Action bumped to its latest release: `cargo update` across the workspace and bench lockfiles, bench_rust `calamine` 0.36, `koffi` 3.3.1, `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` 18.10.1 and `xunit.runner.visualstudio` 4.0.0, `uv.lock` (`ruff` 0.16.8), the bench pins `markitdown` 0.1.7 / `python-docx` 1.2.0 / `xlrd` 2.0.2 (the BENCHMARKS.md table predates these pins), and SHA-pinned `action-gh-release` 3.0.3, `codeql-action` 4.37.4, `setup-uv` 10.1.0, `codecov-action` 7.1.1, `rust-cache` 2.9.2, `install-action` 2.87.16, `rust-toolchain` current. `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` clean.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-09-11

> Write-path correctness. 16 issues closed and the OOXML validation gate that found them.
>
> v0.1.10 shipped with a green suite and a write path that produced documents Word and PowerPoint refuse to open: nothing checked that the files we *write* are valid OOXML, because generated output was only round-tripped through our own deliberately lenient parser. #199 came in from a user; chasing it with a schema validator turned up fifteen more.
>
> Verified against 6,062 real Office documents arm-to-arm with v0.1.10 — **0 extraction regressions**, and `save_as` conversions that schema-validate go from **2,387/5,921 (40.3%) to 5,918/5,921 (99.9%)**. The sweep itself found nine further defects the unit suite could not see, four of them introduced by fixes in this release.

### Verified

Swept **6,062 real Office documents** (LibreOffice QA, Apache POI, OpenXML SDK, python-pptx, ClosedXML, calamine, PhpSpreadsheet and others) arm-to-arm against v0.1.10, on two axes.

**Extraction — no regressions.** 6,062 files × 4 surfaces = 24,248 observations per arm. **0 ok→not-ok**, 3 recoveries. The only text change is one file where a time that rounded up to a whole day now carries into the date instead of rendering hour 24. Three anomalous status transitions were re-measured quiescently and were load artifacts, not regressions — the sweep README warns about exactly that.

**Conversion — the axis this release changes.** Every file through `Document::save_as`, then schema-validated:

| source | v0.1.10 | v0.1.11 |
|---|---|---|
| `.doc` → `.docx` | 92 / 201 | **201 / 201** |
| `.docx` → `.docx` | 60 / 2509 | **2507 / 2509** |
| `.ppt` → `.pptx` | 0 / 176 | **176 / 176** |
| `.pptx` → `.pptx` | 0 / 791 | **791 / 791** |
| `.xls` → `.xlsx` | 469 / 475 | **475 / 475** |
| `.xlsx` → `.xlsx` | 1766 / 1769 | **1768 / 1769** |
| **total** | **2387 / 5921 (40.3%)** | **5918 / 5921 (99.9%)** |

Zero regressions. The three remaining files fail identically under v0.1.10: two carry a malformed `dcterms:modified` in the source (`2015sss-06-20T07:40:00Z`) that is copied through verbatim, and one is a deeply nested table.

The sweep found **nine defects the unit suite could not see**, all fixed here — including three element-ordering defects of the same shape (`w:pPr`, `w:tblPr`, `w:tcPr`), two namespace declarations missing from parts that use them, and one duplicate attribute I introduced while fixing a missing one.

### Added

- **An OOXML validation gate ([#201](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/201)).** Nothing checked that the documents this library *writes* are valid — generated files were only round-tripped through our own lenient parser, so a document Word refuses to open passed the whole suite. `scripts/ooxml-validate/` now fetches the ISO/IEC 29500-4 schemas (not committed, per CONTRIBUTING #4), `cargo run --example gen_validation_corpus` produces 30 packages across the markdown path, the builder APIs, all nine `save_as` conversion pairs and out-of-range values, and both validators run in CI. Writing it immediately found three more defects: `w:titlePg` emitted in the wrong `CT_SectPr` position, `xml:space` on an XLSX `<t>` where it is not allowed, and an empty `p:txBody` on a slide whose only content was a table.

### Security

- **A sub-1 KB `.docx` could abort the process (`CWE-770`).** `w:gridSpan` was parsed as an unbounded `u32` and summed straight into an allocation, so a 978-byte file could request 34 GB and abort. Measured: 1e6 → 11 MB, 8e6 → 64 MB, `u32::MAX` → abort, i.e. ~35,000,000× amplification. This ran on `to_ir()`, which backs `save_as`, `to_markdown`, the MCP `extract` tool and every binding, and an `abort()` is not catchable — no caller could defend against it. Spans are now clamped where the IR cell is built, in the converter's column count, and defensively in `ir_render::table_grid`, since `DocumentIR` is `Deserialize` and can arrive from an untrusted source.
- **A hostile `.pptx` could hang `save_as` indefinitely.** `col_span`/`row_span` drove the DOCX writer's grid loop with the bounds check *inside* the loop body, so the iteration still ran `row_span × col_span` times — up to 1.8×10¹⁹ — doing nothing. Nothing allocated, so nothing ever stopped it. The check is now hoisted and the spans clamped, and PPTX spans are clamped at parse time.
- **A deeply nested IR overflowed the writer's stack.** The readers have bounded nesting via `DepthGuard`/`MAX_NESTING_DEPTH`; the writers had no equivalent, so nesting past a few thousand levels aborted. The same guard now covers both DOCX writer recursions.

- **A negate overflow panicked the writer.** `first_line_indent_twips = i32::MIN` reached `(-v).to_string()` and `-i32::MIN` overflows; the reader had the mirror problem on `w:hanging="-2147483648"`. Both now use the magnitude, which is what `ST_TwipsMeasure` wants — the attribute is unsigned.

Known and not fixed: dropping a deeply nested `Element` is itself recursive and can overflow a small stack independently of the writers. That affects any consumer deserialising such an IR and needs an iterative `Drop`.

### Fixed

- **Two regressions caught by the v0.1.10 → v0.1.11 corpus sweep**, both introduced by fixes in this release. Speaker notes reached `plain_text` and markdown but not HTML, because moving them out of `Section::elements` for [#203](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/203) dropped them from the one renderer that was never updated; HTML now emits them in a labelled `<aside class="speaker-notes">`, which is better than v0.1.10, where they were indistinguishable from slide body text. And [#207](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/207)'s built-in format resolution widened `apply_format`'s custom-code branch, so a built-in code was fed to `apply_custom` and rendered literally — a cell formatted `mm:ss.0` came out as `mm:ss0.6`. The render paths now pass the workbook's *declared* code only.

- **The PPTX writer flattened structure into text ([#214](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/214)).** Tables were joined with literal tabs and newlines into a single run, losing the grid and every cell boundary; they are now written as a real `a:tbl` in a `p:graphicFrame`. Bullet lists were emitted at level 0 with no `marL`/`indent`, so nesting was invisible and the glyph sat at the same x as its text. Footnote and endnote bodies fell into a catch-all and were dropped entirely.

- **The markdown front end dropped fenced code blocks and list nesting ([#215](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/215)).** A ` ```rust ` fence produced no `Element::CodeBlock` at all — the language leaked into the text as an ordinary paragraph — and `ListItem::nested` was hardcoded to `None`, so every bullet flattened to level 0. The second of those is also why the earlier "3-level nested lists" coverage could not have caught [#211](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/211): the markdown path never populated the field.

- **Every binding discarded the writer's "value not written" signal ([#209](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/209)).** `sheet_set_cell` and the PPTX slide setters return `bool` precisely so a silent no-op is detectable — the Rust API was fixed for that regression and all six bindings reintroduced it. The C FFI entry points now return a status, Python raises `IndexError`, and C# throws; an unrecognised FFI `value_type` is rejected instead of erasing the existing cell; and `CellData::Boolean`/`Formula`, previously unreachable from any binding, have `value_type` 3 and 4. Go silently wrote an **empty** cell for `int64`, `float32`, `uint` and a styled `bool`, and C# used a locale-dependent `ToString()` that turned a `decimal` into text (`"1,5"` under `de-DE`); both now cover the full numeric set, with C# using the invariant culture.

- **`replace_text` reported success for XLSX, where it is not implemented ([#210](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/210)).** It returned `0`, which is indistinguishable from "the text was not present", so the CLI exited 0, the MCP tool returned a non-error result, and the file was rewritten anyway — with the MCP schema advertising XLSX support. It now returns an error naming the unsupported format, and the MCP tool description no longer claims XLSX. The edit path is also byte-deterministic again: parts, part relationships and content-type overrides were iterated out of `HashMap`s, so saving an unchanged document produced a different byte stream every time.

- **IR fields the API accepted were never emitted ([#213](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/213)).** `TextSpan::hyperlink` was read and explicitly discarded, so a markdown link's URL was not recoverable from the output at all — DOCX now emits `w:hyperlink` with an external relationship, and run coalescing treats the URL as part of a run's identity so a link is no longer swallowed by an adjacent plain run. PPTX dropped `InlineContent::LineBreak` (joining the words on either side), underline and strikethrough, and image alt text; XLSX and PPTX omitted `xml:space="preserve"`, so leading and trailing spaces were stripped by conformant consumers; `Paragraph::tabs` reached no writer, costing dot-leader tables of contents both their leaders and their alignment; and `frame_position`, `Section::background_rgb` and `Table::caption` were likewise dropped — the caption was emitted only as a `Caption`-styled paragraph, so it was lost on round-trip while accumulating a phantom body paragraph on every cycle.

- **The XLSX write bridge discarded typed cell data ([#212](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/212)).** It re-parsed the *rendered* string instead of using the `data_type`, `raw_number` and `number_format` the reader had recorded, so on any XLSX round trip `"007"` became `7`, currency and date cells became text, and a cell whose text reads `inf` or `NaN` became an Excel error cell. `ir_to_xlsx` also ended in a catch-all that swallowed lists, code blocks, notes and everything inside a text box — and since PPTX wraps slide bodies in a text box, PPTX → XLSX lost almost all of its text. `CellStyle::number_format_code` is new, so a format read from a source document is carried through instead of flattened to `General`.

- **Nested content was silently dropped on write ([#211](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/211)).** `ListItem::nested` was consumed by the renderers but by no writer, so every list item below level 0 vanished from the output while the API reported success — on any document opened and re-saved. A heading nested in a table cell, text box, header or note also lost its alignment, unlike the identical heading at top level.

- **Generated DOCX carried dangling cross-part references ([#208](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/208)).** These are schema-valid and still make Word report unreadable content, so neither the XSDs nor any existing test caught them. A list in a header, footer or note emitted `w:numId`/`ListParagraph` while the numbering part and the style were gated on the body alone; the note-reference character styles were gated on a note part existing, though a run can carry a reference without one; `footnotes.xml` never contained the separator notes Word expects; a `w:type="first"` header was written without `w:titlePg` and a `w:type="even"` one without `settings.xml`, so neither was ever shown; a multi-section document emitted duplicate `w:type` values in the final `sectPr`; and an ordered list nested in a cell, text box or header used the bullet definition, disagreeing with the same list at top level.

- **A workbook's own `numFmt` override was ignored for built-in ids ([#207](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/207)).** [ECMA-376] §18.8.30 lets a workbook redefine ids 0-163, but the date check consulted the id before the declaration, so a number formatted `0.00" kg"` under id 14 was read back as `1900-01-02`. `StyleSheet::number_format_for` now also resolves built-in ids instead of returning `None` for the majority of real formatted cells, with `number_format_override_for` exposing the explicit declaration alone. Separately, a time fraction that rounds up to a whole day now carries into the date rather than producing hour 24, which no date library accepts.

- **The XLSX writer produced unparseable, invalid or silently wrong output on unusual input ([#206](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/206)).** A control character in a sheet name made `xl/workbook.xml` unparseable — `sanitize_xml_text` guarded element text but had never been applied to an attribute. `merge_cells` overflowed `usize` and panicked inside `save()`. `add_row` bypassed the grid check `set_cell` enforces and wrote cells past column XFD. Colours, column widths and font sizes were written through unvalidated (`inf`, `FFred`, `sz="0"`); half-point font sizes were truncated by integer division; a zero-sheet workbook emitted an invalid empty `<sheets/>`; a styled empty cell silently dropped its style; a formula kept a caller's leading `=`; and `styles.xml` was non-deterministic because it iterated a `HashMap`.

- **The XLSX edit path corrupted workbooks ([#205](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/205)).** A self-closing `<row .../>` — what Excel writes for a row carrying only a custom height — made `set_cell` insert the new cell into the **next** row, so a cell whose reference said row 1 ended up inside row 2. The same fix class had already been applied to self-closing `<c>` and was never carried over to `<row>`. Cells and rows are now also inserted in ascending order as [ECMA-376] §18.3.1.73 requires, control characters are stripped, and non-finite numbers become error cells instead of raw `NaN`/`inf` — both guards the writer already had and the editor lacked.

- **PPTX attribute values were written without range validation ([#204](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/204)).** `p:sldSz`, `a:rPr/@sz`, `a:srgbClr/@val` and `a:ext` all took caller input straight into restricted XSD types. `font_size(f64::NAN)` became `sz="0"` through a saturating float cast, and `.color("#FF0000")` — the form every CSS-adjacent API accepts — produced an invalid file. The slide-size case needed no explicit API call: the IR bridge converts a source page size straight to EMU, so any page under an inch produced an invalid deck.

- **Speaker notes were promoted onto the visible slide ([#203](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/203)).** The PPTX converter appended notes to the slide's `elements` as an ordinary paragraph, so every writer treated them as body text and a round trip published a presenter's private notes to the audience with no marker. Notes now live in `Section::speaker_notes` and round-trip into `ppt/notesSlides/`; the renderers still surface them, labelled.

- **DOCX documents were schema-invalid in six ways ([#200](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/200)).** `w:tblGrid` was written only when explicit column widths were known, so every markdown table was invalid; the simple `add_table` writer emitted neither `w:tblPr` nor `w:tblGrid`; `numbering.xml` interleaved `w:abstractNum` and `w:num` instead of writing all of the former first; both floating-anchor writers put `wp:docPr` before the wrap element; `w:pgMar` omitted the required `w:gutter`; and `w:pPr` children were emitted in the wrong order. The `w:pPr` fix covers more than the reported `spacing`/`ind` pair — `w:numPr`, `w:pBdr` and `w:shd` were also misplaced, and the whole block now follows the `CT_PPrBase` sequence.

- **PPTX packages were missing the theme, `presProps.xml` and the layout→master relationship ([#202](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/202)).** The slide layout had no `_rels` part at all, so it was orphaned from its master — a hard `shall` in [ISO/IEC 29500-1] §13.3.9 and a likely reason PowerPoint's repair failed rather than succeeded. There was also no theme, which left [#199](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/199)'s colour map naming slots that did not exist.

- **PPTX slide masters were missing the required `p:clrMap` ([#199](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/199)).** `CT_SlideMaster` is a strict sequence — `cSld`, `clrMap`, `sldLayoutIdLst` — and the colour map was never written at all, so every deck this library produced was schema-invalid and PowerPoint's repair had no colour mapping to recover.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-09-09

> Correctness release. 69 issues closed, concentrated in one defect shape: **the parser read a value correctly and the converter then dropped it**. Every format is affected; DOCX most of all. Also closes six security-relevant robustness gaps, adds editing to the WASM/MCP/CLI surfaces, and replaces several silent empty-successes with named errors. No breaking API changes; some previously-empty fields are now populated, and some previously-`Ok(empty)` reads are now `Err`.
>
> Verified against a 3,036-file corpus of real Office documents (Apache POI, Tika, LibreOffice QA, ClosedXML, OpenXML SDK test suites) compared arm-to-arm against v0.1.9: zero panics, zero crashes, zero timeouts, and no content regression. The harness that did it ships in `scripts/regression-sweep/`.

### Added

- **Editing on every surface ([#62](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/62)).** `replace_text` and save now reach the CLI, MCP server and WASM build, not just the Rust and Python APIs.
- **Inline base64 images in markdown ([#100](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/100)).** `to_markdown_with(MarkdownOptions { image_embed: ImageEmbed::Base64 })` emits `[image-base64:...]` at each image's position in the flow; the MCP `extract` tool exposes it as the `markdown-with-images` format.
- **Per-platform npm packages ([#61](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/61)).** The JS package now uses `optionalDependencies` for its six platform binaries instead of shipping all of them to every install.
- **Document metadata is read ([#174](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/174)).** `ir::Metadata` title, author and dates were always `None` even though `CoreProperties::parse` existed and worked.
- **Footnotes, endnotes, comments and speaker notes ([#142](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/142), [#143](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/143), [#165](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/165), [#195](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/195)).** DOCX `footnotes.xml`/`endnotes.xml`/`comments.xml`, XLSX `xl/comments*.xml`, PPTX `ppt/comments/*` and `notesSlides`, and the `.doc` subdocuments the FIB's `ccp*` lengths had been parsed for and never used.
- **Legacy images reach the IR ([#186](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/186)).** `.doc`/`.xls`/`.ppt` extracted pictures were being dropped during conversion.

### Fixed

#### Content silently dropped on read

- **XML entities and character references were deleted from text ([#156](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/156)).** `AT&T` extracted as `ATT`. quick-xml emits entity references as `Event::GeneralRef`, a separate event from `Event::Text`, and 30 handlers across every format matched only the latter. Attribute values were affected too — the root cause behind [#147](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/147). This one change recovers apostrophes, ampersands and non-ASCII characters across the whole corpus.
- **DOCX text-box content ([#140](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/140), [#102](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/102)) and transparent paragraph wrappers ([#141](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/141)).** `w:txbxContent` was never read; `w:ins`, `w:fldSimple`, `w:ruby` and `w:smartTag` text was dropped on the floor. Both returned `Ok`.
- **DOCX `w:cr`, `w:noBreakHyphen` and `w:sym` ([#152](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/152)).** `e-mail` extracted as `email`.
- **DOCX `altChunk`, image alt text and HYPERLINK field URLs ([#155](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/155)); internal `w:anchor` hyperlinks and `w:tblCaption` ([#189](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/189)).**
- **XLSX cell hyperlinks ([#164](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/164)).** Parsed into `Worksheet::hyperlinks`, then never rendered — while DOCX and PPTX both emitted links.
- **PPTX SmartArt and chart text ([#149](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/149)); `a:tbl` merge continuation cells ([#148](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/148)).** `graphicFrame` handled only the table URI, and dropped `vMerge`/`hMerge` cells shifted every cell to their right one column left.
- **DOCX `mc:AlternateContent` extracted both `Choice` and `Fallback` ([#163](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/163)) — shape text came out twice.**

#### Formatting parsed and then discarded

- **DOCX style-based formatting was never applied ([#194](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/194)).** Only direct `w:rPr`/`w:pPr` survived, so an ordinarily-styled document lost all of its formatting.
- **DOCX run and paragraph properties ([#181](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/181), [#182](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/182)).** Indent, spacing, line spacing and keep/page-break flags were lost on read — only alignment survived; underline, highlight, `vertAlign`, caps and smallCaps left half of `TextSpan`'s fields permanently empty.
- **DOCX table geometry ([#180](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/180)) and borders ([#190](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/190)).** `tblW`, `gridCol`, `tcW`, `tblCellMar` and `trHeight` were all lost, so the library could not read back the widths of tables it had written; `w:pBdr` was narrowed to a boolean and `tblBorders`/`tcBorders` were not parsed at all.
- **DOCX `w:themeColor` never resolved and discarded the `w:val` fallback ([#175](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/175)).** `resolve_color` existed and was never called.
- **DOCX headings, lists and breaks ([#154](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/154), [#187](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/187), [#188](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/188), [#185](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/185), [#135](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/135)).** Headings were identified only via `outlineLvl`, missing style-name and `Heading1..9` conventions; `w:numId="0"` (explicitly *no* numbering) was turned into a bullet list; `List::start_number` and `List::style` were never populated, so a list starting at 5 rendered as 1 and `a) b) c)` was indistinguishable from `1. 2. 3.`; page breaks were reported as `ThematicBreak` and column breaks dropped; `w:outlineLvl="9"` (body text) rendered as a heading.
- **DOCX sections ([#177](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/177), [#178](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/178), [#191](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/191)).** Column layout was written in full and read back with only the count; first-page and even-page headers were merged into one and every section received every section's headers; `Section::break_type` was hardcoded from the section index, with continuous/nextPage inverted.
- **XLSX ([#184](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/184), [#179](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/179), [#193](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/193)) and PPTX ([#183](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/183), [#150](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/150), [#192](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/192)).** Cell font formatting reached the IR in prose mode but not table mode — the same cell rendered differently depending on the shape of the sheet around it; landscape orientation was not applied to `paperSize` dimensions; hidden sheets and slides were extracted with no indication; PPTX run underline, font name, baseline, caps and spacing were never parsed; level-0 bullets rendered as plain paragraphs and `a:buAutoNum` numbering was lost; `TableRow::is_header` was set from row position rather than `a:tblPr/@firstRow`.

#### Wrong values

- **XLSX number formats ([#147](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/147)).** Quoted literals in custom formats were read as date tokens, so `12,500,000` rendered as `36123-11-01`. Format sections are now selected by their condition rather than by position, `?` is treated as a digit placeholder, and a format's code is no longer printed in place of its value.
- **XLSX cell placement ([#146](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/146)).** The column reference was discarded, so sparse or unordered rows put every value under the wrong header. Cells whose `r` attribute is absent now take the next column, and rows without `r` are numbered in document order, per ECMA-376 18.3.1.4 and 18.3.1.73.
- **XLS dates ([#172](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/172)).** `FORMAT` and `XF` records were never parsed, so dates extracted as raw serials (`38971` instead of a date).
- **`.doc` outline levels ([#139](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/139)).** The line-shape heading heuristic now defers to real outline data where it exists.

#### Silent success on unreadable input

- **Word 6.0/95 files were accepted and parsed with Word 97 offsets ([#167](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/167)).** 426,450 characters extracted as an empty string with `Ok`. Now a named error.
- **Encrypted legacy files ([#169](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/169)) and encrypted OOXML packages ([#119](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/119), partial).** Both returned empty text or a corrupt-zip failure; both now say the file is password-protected. Reading and writing ECMA-376 agile encryption is **not** implemented — see *Known gaps*.
- **Valid real-world `.doc`/`.ppt` files extracted as an empty string with `Ok` ([#168](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/168)).** The reported cause — a three-piece piece table — parses correctly and now has a test pinning it. The real defect was three silent empty-with-`Ok` returns in the `.doc` reader, which now name the structure that failed.
- **OOXML robustness ([#145](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/145), [#176](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/176)).** Truncated XML, wrong-format packages and duplicate parts all returned `Ok`; a malformed theme part made the whole document unreadable while a missing theme was fine.
- **`with_parse_stack` converted every internal panic into "unsupported format" ([#161](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/161)),** hiding real bugs and blinding the fuzz target.

#### Security and robustness

- **Unbounded parser recursion ([#151](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/151)).** A 1.6 KB `.docx` aborted the process with a stack overflow no caller could catch. Nesting is now capped at an empirically calibrated depth, with the excess reported rather than silently truncated.
- **No decompression limit on OOXML parts ([#144](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/144)).** A 2 MB `.docx` expanded to 2 GiB in memory and returned `Ok`. Parts are now bounded.
- **Emitted URLs were not scheme-filtered and markdown output was unescaped ([#157](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/157)).** `javascript:` reached `href`.
- **The write path emitted XML-illegal control characters ([#158](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/158)),** producing documents Word, Excel and LibreOffice all reject.
- **`replace_text` corrupted the document on `&` ([#159](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/159)),** never matched escaped text, and injected raw markup.
- **Panic on a malformed CFB header ([#138](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/138)).** An unvalidated sector shift overflowed in `cfb/header.rs`.
- **Element dispatch ignored XML namespaces ([#162](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/162)),** so foreign-namespace text was extracted as document content.
- **XLSX/PPTX writers validated nothing ([#173](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/173), [#160](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/160)).** An out-of-range sheet index silently dropped data, illegal sheet names and out-of-grid cells were accepted, and non-finite numbers were written as `<v>inf</v>`/`<v>NaN</v>` — a schema-invalid workbook, returned as `Ok`.

#### Renderers disagreeing with each other

- **DOCX had two markdown renderers that disagreed ([#137](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/137), [#166](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/166), [#136](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/136), [#134](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/134)),** and the IR path duplicated each section's first heading. Headers and footers appeared only in markdown, `<img>` was emitted without a source, and markdown `---` leaked into `plain_text`. `Heading::level`'s documented invariant is now enforced, and the `outline_level` doc comment no longer states its value space backwards.
- **Adjacent emphasis runs were not coalesced ([#153](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/153)),** producing literal `****` in the output, and `vertAlign` was lost.
- **PPT slide-master placeholder prompts were extracted as content ([#170](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/170)).** "Click to edit Master title style" is no longer document text.
- **IR round-trip was unbounded ([#171](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/171)).** Image alt text was written back as body text, growing the document on every generation.

#### Packaging

- **`go/cmd/install` 404'd on every run ([#110](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/110)).** The download URL put the version in the asset filename.

### Testing

- **Mechanical gates for parser correctness ([#133](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/133)).** SPRM opcode identity is now asserted against a table transcribed from [MS-DOC], so a wrong opcode fails a test rather than silently mis-parsing.
- **Release regression sweep (`scripts/regression-sweep/`).** Two arms — the previous tag and the release branch — run over a corpus of real Office documents, compared on two axes: status transitions and word-level content change. `vanished.py` is the check that decides content loss, because byte totals cannot: restoring a dropped `&` makes output longer and dropping 65,536 rows of grid padding makes it far shorter, and both swamp any aggregate. It found seven defects that 800+ synthetic tests could not see, including two introduced during this release.
- The suite grew from 792 to 818 tests, all fixtures built in code.

### Known gaps

- **[#119](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/119) is deliberately partial.** An encrypted OOXML file now reports that it is password-protected instead of failing as a corrupt zip. Reading and writing ECMA-376 agile encryption is not implemented: it needs four cryptography dependencies plus a CFB writer that does not exist here, and neither half can be verified in this repository without an Office-produced encrypted fixture. Shipping encryption that does not interoperate with Word would be the same confidently-wrong failure the rest of this release removes.
- **No external reference panel.** Every judgement in the regression sweep is 0.1.10 against v0.1.9, so a defect both versions share does not show up. Comparing against LibreOffice, Tika or pandoc remains future work.


## [0.1.9] - 2026-09-01

> Legacy binary `.doc` structure release: tables, lists, and tab stops are now recovered into the IR, closing the long-standing fidelity gap against the `.docx` path. Plus an IR list-nesting fix, green lint gates, and a dependency refresh. No breaking API changes.
>
> Both `.doc` features in this release were contributed by **[@xugangqiang](https://github.com/xugangqiang)** — thank you.

### Added

- **`.doc`: tables are extracted into the IR ([#115](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/115), [#116](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/pull/116)).** For legacy binary Word files, `Document::to_ir()` (and therefore `to_ir_json()`, `to_markdown()`, and every binding built on them) previously emitted only `Paragraph` and heuristic `Heading` elements — table structure that exists in the file was silently dropped, while the `.docx` path emitted `Table` elements from the same API. Tables are now rebuilt by walking the structured paragraphs from the PAPX FKP of the table stream: a row ends at a `sprmTDefTable` row-terminator paragraph, a cell at a `\x07`-terminated paragraph. `col_span` is computed from the shared column-grid edges (the column-boundary union, Apache POI `buildTableCellEdgesArray` style) with a 4-twip snap tolerance, since Word rounds per row; `row_span` is driven by the **2-bit** `TCGRF.fVertMerge` field (`fvmClear` / `fvmMerge` / `fvmRestart`), including a guard for Word's whole-TAP-copy quirk where continuation rows wrongly carry `fvmRestart`. Nested tables (`itap > 1`) are flattened with a visible notice rather than silently mis-rendered. Carries shared parser hardening that underpins the walk: non-monotonic CP now returns `Err`, a `cw == 0` FKP re-read off-by-one is fixed, `fc_to_cp` is overflow-protected, and `decode_cp_range` is byte-clamped against a DoS. Every fixture is a minimal synthetic `.doc` built in code. Thanks @xugangqiang.
- **`.doc`: lists and tab stops are extracted into the IR ([#115](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/115), [#120](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/pull/120)).** Building on the table walker. **Lists** key membership on the list format override id (`ilfo`, set by `sprmPIlfo` `0x460B`) per [MS-DOC] §2.4.6.3 rather than on the level SPRM alone, read as a signed `i16`: `0x0000` and `0xF801` mean "not in a list"; `0x0001`–`0x07FE` index into `PlfLfo.rgLfo`; `0xF802`–`0xFFFF` are the negation of a 1-based index and are still list items. Consecutive list paragraphs group into a nested `Element::List`, with nesting driven by `ilvl`. **Tab stops** are decoded from `sprmPChgTabs` (`0xC615`) and `sprmPChgTabsPapx` (`0xC60D`) — both carry a 1-byte `cb`, with `cb == 255` an escape for `0xC615` that derives the operand length from the payload's own `cDel`/`cAdd` counts, and the two opcodes differing only in their delete block (`PchgTabsDelClose`, `1 + 4·cDel`, vs `PchgTabsDel`, `1 + 2·cDel`) — and surfaced on the paragraph's `tabs`. The `0xXXXX` opcode identities and the `cb`/delete-block byte contracts are asserted directly, so the tests double as a spec-conformance gate. Two known gaps remain, documented rather than papered over: a negated `ilfo` is not yet resolved to a positive index, and a list whose `ilfo` is inherited only through a paragraph style is not yet detected. Thanks @xugangqiang.

### Fixed

- **IR: a list whose items all sit at the same non-zero depth no longer loses every item but the first ([#122](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/pull/122)).** `ir::build_nested_list` decided each item's children by comparing the following items against the run's `base_level` instead of against that item's own level. When every item in a run was deeper than `base_level`, the first item claimed the whole run as its child range, discarded it (because the item itself was not shallow enough to be a parent), and still advanced the cursor past the range — silently dropping the rest. Both call sites pass a hard-coded `base_level` of 0, so **any list whose items all sit at level ≥ 1 lost all but its first item**: a PowerPoint placeholder whose bullets are all `<a:p lvl="1">` is an ordinary shape, and it measured 3 bullets in → 1 list item out. DOCX reached the same path through `<w:numPr w:ilvl>`. Grouping now uses each item's own depth and always advances to the end of the consumed range.

### CI / tooling (dev-only, not shipped)

- **Clippy: constant-size `chunks_exact` rewritten as `as_chunks` ([#124](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/pull/124)).** Rust 1.98's clippy added `chunks_exact_to_as_chunks`; two call sites (`src/cfb/reader.rs`, `src/ppt/text.rs`) tripped it, and both the Clippy and Lint jobs run with `-D warnings`, so `main` itself failed. `as_chunks::<N>()` discards the remainder exactly as `chunks_exact` did, so behaviour is identical, and it hands `from_le_bytes` a `[u8; N]` directly. `as_chunks` stabilised in Rust 1.88, this workspace's declared `rust-version`, so the MSRV job is unaffected.
- **Python lint: 31 ruff findings cleared and the linter pinned to a minor series ([#123](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/pull/123)).** `ruff>=0.4` was unpinned, so CI resolved whatever ruff published most recently and each release turned on new default rules — the gate changed under the repo with no commit, reddening every open PR including bumps that touch no Python at all. 29 of the findings were in the `_native.pyi` stub (PYI044/PYI026/PYI034/PYI036, PEP 604/585 unions — valid in a stub regardless of the `requires-python = ">=3.8"` runtime floor, since stubs are never evaluated at runtime), the other 2 import and `__all__` ordering. `ruff` is now pinned `>=0.16,<0.17`.
- **Dependency refresh**: `pyo3` 0.29.0 → 0.29.2, `thiserror` 2.0.19 → 2.0.20, `clap` 4.6.4 → 4.6.6, `log` 0.4.33 → 0.4.34, `fast-float2` 0.2.3 → 0.2.4, `koffi` 3.1.2 → 3.1.6 (JS binding), plus a bulk in-semver lockfile refresh ([#99](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/pull/99)). Pinned GitHub Actions: `ossf/scorecard-action` 2.4.3 → 2.4.4, `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` 1.14.1 → 1.14.2.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-07-22

> PPT97 (legacy binary `.ppt`) text-extraction correctness release. No breaking API changes.

### Fixed

- **PPT: `PlainText()` / `ToMarkdown()` / `ToIRJSON()` no longer return stale or embedded-metadata text instead of real slide content on legacy binary `.ppt` files ([#85](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/85)).** PPT97 uses incremental ("fast") saves — each save appends new/changed records to the end of the "PowerPoint Document" stream, leaving superseded copies of earlier records (e.g. a pre-edit `Slide` container) behind in the stream with nothing to compact them away. The extractor scanned front-to-back and trusted whichever slide-shaped data it found first, so stale leftovers could win over current content, and in the worst case a corrupted/oversized declared record length (the record iterator bounded child data against the whole stream rather than its own enclosing container) could derail the scan and swallow unrelated later records. Slide content is now resolved through the PPT97 persist object directory instead — `Current User` stream → `UserEditAtom` chain (`offsetLastEdit`) → merged `PersistDirectoryAtom` entries, per [MS-PPT] 2.1.2 — so the *current* copy of each slide's records is used regardless of scan order, and the record iterator now bounds each record against its own container. Also resolves `OutlineTextRefAtom` indirection, where a placeholder shape stores text only as an index back into the slide's outline-text cache rather than embedding it directly — needed for correctness against a real-world corpus, not just the reported bug. Verified against 176 real-world `.ppt` files (LibreOffice QA data, Apache POI/Tika test resources, OSS-Fuzz regression cases): zero crashes either side vs. v0.1.7, and every file with changed output gained previously-missing content (stale duplicates collapsed, indexed placeholder text now resolved) with no garbled output observed. Thanks to the reporter of #85.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-07-19

> Round-trip and robustness release: the write↔parse IR cycle is now a fixed point for DOCX/PPTX, oversized XLSX sheets are bounded instead of stalling, plus the earlier XLSX cell-type/DOCX-truncation/XLSX-edit fixes, a dependency refresh, and CI-hardening + IP-governance groundwork. No breaking API changes.

### Added

- **IR spreadsheet cells now carry their semantic type and number format ([#72](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/72)).** Previously `Document::to_ir()` (and therefore the WASM `toIr()` surface) flattened every XLSX cell to a display string, so consumers could not tell a number or date cell from text — a `42` and a `"42"` looked identical, and a date serial under a date format was indistinguishable from a number. `TableCell` gains four optional, `serde`-defaulted fields populated on the XLSX grid path: `data_type` (`text` / `number` / `date` / `boolean` / `error`, via the new `CellDataType` enum), `raw_number` (the underlying `f64` — dates as an Excel serial, booleans as `1.0`/`0.0`), `number_format` (the format code, e.g. `"#,##0.00"`), and `number_format_id` (built-in or custom `numFmtId`, e.g. `14` for a date). The fields are `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`, so DOCX/PPTX table cells and existing JSON consumers are unaffected. Format metadata is surfaced on **every** non-empty cell — including text cells — so a caller can also tell that a text cell sits in a date-formatted column (a real case from the reporter's workbook, where a "date" column held typed-in text). Built-in format IDs (which never appear in `<numFmts>`) resolve to their canonical code via a new `numfmt::builtin_format_code`, so `number_format` is populated for built-ins like `14` → `"m/d/yyyy"` and `4` → `"#,##0.00"`, not just custom formats. Reuses the existing date-detection and number-format resolution logic rather than duplicating it. Thanks to the reporter for the clear request.

### Fixed

- **DOCX: `to_markdown()` / `docx_to_ir` no longer silently truncate the body on paragraphs with a bordered `<w:pBdr>` ([#71](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/71)).** A paragraph carrying Word's horizontal-rule idiom (an empty paragraph whose `pPr` holds a bottom-border-only `<w:pBdr>`) desynced the reader: after detecting the self-closing `<w:bottom/>` edge, the `pBdr` scanner issued a stray extra read that swallowed the `</w:pBdr>` close tag when no whitespace separated them (i.e. in real, non-pretty-printed Word output). With the border's end tag consumed and the loop keyed to break only on `</w:pBdr>`, the shared reader ran to EOF — dropping every subsequent paragraph and table and returning `Ok` with a partial document. The scanner now walks the `<w:pBdr>` subtree with a balanced depth counter and exits at the matching close, so trailing content is preserved. Thanks to the reporter for the precise measurements.
- **XLSX edit: `set_cell` no longer strips a cell's attributes, and no longer deletes the next cell when writing into an empty-but-styled one.** `set_cell_in_xml` rebuilt the `<c>` element from scratch — emitting only `r` and `t` — so every other attribute of the overwritten cell was discarded, most importantly `s`, the style index: a currency or date cell came back with no number format. Worse, the replacement located the end of the cell by searching for `</c>` *before* checking whether the opening tag was self-closing; an empty-but-styled cell is written `<c r="A1" s="5"/>` with no `</c>`, so the search ran on and found the **next** cell's closing tag, and the splice swallowed the cell in between. Both defects converge on the same real workflow — injecting values into a pre-formatted spreadsheet template, whose data rows are made entirely of styled, empty cells: the write silently destroyed a neighbouring cell and stripped the formatting off the one it wrote. `set_cell` now carries every attribute of the existing cell through verbatim (except `r` and `t`, which it owns) and delimits the opening tag before deciding how the element ends.
- **DOCX/PPTX: `create_from_ir` (and `create_from_markdown`) round-trips are now idempotent ([#79](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/79)).** Writing an IR and reading it back drifted on every cycle: a document/slide title is surfaced by the parsers as **both** `section.title` **and** a leading heading, and the writer re-emitted the title on top of that heading. For DOCX this materialised a duplicate H1 that grew monotonically each write→parse cycle; for PPTX the title was re-emitted as body text and — because `emit_pptx_element` had **no arm for `Element::TextBox`**, the wrapper the parser puts slide-body content in — the real body (bullets, paragraphs) was silently dropped, leaving only the title echo. The writer now skips a standalone title when it is already the section's leading heading (both formats) and emits `Element::TextBox` content into the slide body, so `parse(write(x))` is a fixed point. Covered by a new `ir_roundtrip_idempotence` test for all three OOXML formats.

### Changed

- **XLSX: worksheets are capped at 10,000 rows when materialised into the IR ([#29](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/29)).** A worksheet is converted eagerly into a single in-memory `Table`, which downstream cannot render to an unbounded PDF, so a pathological sheet (e.g. a 200k-row fixture) exploded memory and stalled rendering. Beyond the cap the remaining rows are dropped and a **visible truncation notice** (`[N of M rows not shown — worksheet truncated at 10000 rows]`) is appended, so the omission is obvious in text/markdown/PDF rather than silent or hanging. Ordinary large spreadsheets are unaffected.
- **Refreshed `Cargo.lock` to latest semver-compatible versions** (in-semver, no manifest changes): `clap` 4.6.1 → 4.6.2, `futures-*` 0.3.32 → 0.3.33, `portable-atomic` 1.13.1 → 1.14.0, `simd-adler32` 0.3.9 → 0.3.10, `thiserror` 2.0.18 → 2.0.19, `syn` 2.0.118 → 2.0.119, and others. `thiserror-impl` 2.0.19 now depends on `syn` 3.0, so the tree carries a second `syn` major transitively; `cargo deny` is clean.

### CI / tooling & governance (dev-only, except NOTICE/TRADEMARKS which ship in the crate)

- **CI hardening.** Least-privilege default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions on the Python workflow (OpenSSF Scorecard Token-Permissions); a `cargo-fuzz` target (`fuzz/`) that feeds arbitrary bytes to every format parser (must never panic/hang); deterministic PR-quality gates (Conventional-Commits title, no committed compiled/binary artifacts, AI-assistance labelling); and template-compliance + CLA-assistant workflows. The `pull_request_target` workflows only read event/API strings and never check out or run PR code.
- **IP governance.** Added [`CLA.md`](CLA.md) (contributor licence agreement — a licence, not an assignment), [`TRADEMARKS.md`](TRADEMARKS.md), [`NOTICE`](NOTICE), and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); `NOTICE` and `TRADEMARKS.md` are now included in the published crate package. The code remains dual-licensed `MIT OR Apache-2.0`.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-13

> Fixes PPTX slides created by `PptxWriter` / `create_from_markdown` rendering blank in LibreOffice Impress.

### Fixed

- **PPTX placeholder shapes now carry explicit geometry ([#69](https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/issues/69)).** The generated title and body placeholders previously emitted an empty `<p:spPr/>` with no `<a:xfrm>`, relying on the slide layout for position/size. PowerPoint resolves that from the layout, but LibreOffice Impress does not — so slides rendered blank. The writer now emits an explicit `<a:xfrm>` (offset + extent) on each placeholder, derived from PowerPoint's default Office-theme rectangles and scaled to the presentation size (`set_presentation_size`). Thanks @holgerreppert for the detailed report.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-13

> Dependency-maintenance release. No API or behavior changes — all 424 tests pass and every feature build (default, `parallel`, `mmap`, `python`, `wasm`) compiles clean.

### Changed

- **Refreshed all Rust dependencies to their latest semver-compatible versions** (lockfile): `clap` 4.5 → 4.6.1, `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.114 → 0.2.126, `js-sys` 0.3.91 → 0.3.103, `libc` 0.2.182 → 0.2.186, `serde_json` 1.0.149 → 1.0.150, `crossbeam-deque` 0.8.6 → 0.8.7, `crossbeam-utils` 0.8.21 → 0.8.22, plus `quote`/`syn`/`itoa`/`either` and others. The crate's version requirements were already broad enough to permit these — intentionally kept loose so downstreams aren't over-constrained.
- **JS binding: `koffi` 2.9 → 3.1.1** (major). Uses only stable core APIs (`load`, `decode`, `disposable`, `func`); koffi 3.x ships native binaries as platform-specific optional packages. Node engine requirement (`>=18`) unchanged.

### CI / tooling (dev-only, not shipped)

- **Pinned GitHub Actions bumped to latest (SHA-pinned):** `checkout` v4 → v7.0.0, `codecov-action` v5 → v7.0.0, `codeql-action` v3 → v4.37.0, `attest-build-provenance` v2 → v4.1.1, `setup-go` v5 → v6.5.0, `setup-dotnet` v4 → v5.4.0, `setup-python` v6.2 → v6.3.0, `setup-uv` v8.1 → v8.3.2, `cargo-deny-action` → v2.0.20, `scorecard-action` → v2.4.3, `action-gh-release` v2 → v3.0.1, `rust-cache` → v2.9.1, `install-action` → v2.83.2, and `actions/cache` moved from a `@v5` tag to a SHA-pinned v6.1.0. Also unified a stray `download-artifact@v4` to v8.0.1 and corrected a stale `github-script` version comment. Subsumes Dependabot #40/#41/#43/#44/#45.
- **pre-commit hooks:** `cargo-deny` 0.19.0 → 0.20.2, `ruff-pre-commit` v0.15.5 → v0.15.21, `ty-pre-commit` v0.0.18 → v0.0.59.
- **C# test deps (test-only):** `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` 17.10 → 18.7.0, `xunit` 2.9.0 → 2.9.3, `xunit.runner.visualstudio` 2.8.2 → 3.1.5.

### Notes

- No new advisories (`cargo audit` / `cargo deny` clean, 81 deps).
- Benchmark competitor pins in `scripts/bench-requirements.txt` are intentionally frozen until the next full benchmark re-run (bumping them would desync the numbers in BENCHMARKS.md), so Dependabot #53/#54 are out of scope here.
- `download-artifact` v4 → v8 and `attest-build-provenance` v2 → v4 run in the release workflow, which only fully executes on a tag; they are validated when v0.1.5 is tagged.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-13

> Build-compatibility fix that unblocks downstream crates from moving to quick-xml ≥ 0.41 (and clearing RUSTSEC-2026-0194 / RUSTSEC-2026-0195) when office_oxide shares a dependency tree with a crate that enables quick-xml's `encoding` feature.

### Fixed

- **quick-xml `encoding`-feature build break** — `unescape_attr_value` called `Attribute::unescape_value()`, which quick-xml gates behind `#[cfg(not(feature = "encoding"))]`. Cargo feature unification turns `encoding` on transitively whenever another crate in the tree enables it (e.g. `calamine ≥ 0.36`), so office_oxide failed to compile with `error[E0599]: no method named unescape_value`. This forced downstreams (e.g. `kreuzberg`) to pin `calamine 0.35`, keeping a vulnerable quick-xml < 0.41 in the tree. The helper now decodes the raw attribute bytes as UTF-8 and expands entities via `escape::unescape`, which is feature-independent. Thanks @waxzce (#63) and @Goldziher (#64).

### Changed

- **`zip` 8.1 → 8.6** and assorted transitive dependency refreshes. Via #64 (@Goldziher).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-04

> Security patch: clears every open RustSec advisory in the dependency tree — an untrusted-XML DoS (quick-xml), two pyo3 soundness/OOB fixes, and a memmap2 unsound-pointer fix — plus Linux aarch64 wheels on PyPI.

### Security

- **quick-xml 0.40 → 0.41 (RUSTSEC-2026-0194 / RUSTSEC-2026-0195)** — quick-xml 0.40's `NamespaceResolver::push` performs an unbounded per-`xmlns` heap allocation inside `NsReader` *before* the parse event is returned, so a crafted Office document (DOCX/XLSX/PPTX) declaring many namespaces could exhaust memory and crash the reader — a denial-of-service on untrusted input. Upgraded to quick-xml 0.41, which bounds the allocation. Thanks @smissingham (#58); tracked in #59.
- **pyo3 0.28 → 0.29 (RUSTSEC-2026-0176 / RUSTSEC-2026-0177)** — fixes an out-of-bounds read in `nth` / `nth_back` for `PyList` and `PyTuple` iterators, and a missing `Sync` bound on `PyCFunction::new_closure` closures, in the Python binding. Via Dependabot (#52).
- **memmap2 0.9.10 → 0.9.11 (RUSTSEC-2026-0186)** — fixes an unchecked pointer offset (unsoundness). Via Dependabot (#55).

### Packaging

- **Linux aarch64 wheels + source distribution on PyPI (#51)** — `pip install office-oxide` on Linux/arm64 (AWS Graviton, Apple-Silicon Docker, Raspberry Pi) failed with "no compatible wheel"; the release workflow now builds `manylinux` aarch64 wheels and an sdist alongside the existing x86_64/macOS wheels. Thanks @regularkevvv.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-14

> Round-trip fidelity, IR layout features, embedded fonts, XLSX number formatting, and an O(1) style-lookup perf win.

### Performance

- **XLSX styles**: cell-format lookups now use a `HashMap`, replacing
  the linear `Vec` scan in `format_cell_value` / `is_date_cell`.
  Per-cell formatting becomes O(1); large styled workbooks parse
  noticeably faster with no API change.

### Round-trip fidelity (PDF → office → PDF)

- **Alignment, spacing, footers, and horizontal rules** preserved end-to-end
  through both `to_docx` and `to_pptx` writers.
- **Images, fonts, and column layouts** preserved across DOCX, PPTX, and
  XLSX. Source-PDF font programs that previously registered as empty
  subsets now embed correctly.
- **`Element::ThematicBreak`** encoded in PPTX as a centered 30-char run
  of `U+2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL`. Downstream PDF renderers
  detect the all-U+2500 content and re-emit a real horizontal rule.
- **DOCX horizontal rules** recovered from the conventional encoding
  (empty paragraph + `<w:pBdr><w:bottom/>`) back into `Element::ThematicBreak`.

### DOCX

- **`<w:framePr>` parsed into IR** as `FramePosition` (twips, page-anchored)
  on both `Paragraph` and `Heading`. Used by layout-preserving paths
  (e.g. pdf_oxide's `to_docx_bytes_layout`).
- **Floating drawings and vector shapes**: `<wp:anchor>` images plus
  `<wps:wsp>` preset shapes (line, rect) with stroke/fill RGB and
  stroke width round-trip through `DrawingInfo`.
- **Per-section page sizes** preserved through `to_ir`; multi-section IR
  emits per-section `<w:sectPr>`.
- **`<w:sz>` preserved** through to IR's `font_size_half_pt`.
- **Run colour** from `<w:rPr><w:color w:val="RRGGBB"/>` propagated into
  `TextSpan.color` during `to_ir`, so PDF→DOCX→PDF round-trips keep
  coloured text. Only the `ColorRef::Rgb` variant is plumbed today;
  theme / system / `auto` colours still fall through to the renderer
  default (proper resolution needs `theme.xml` threaded into the
  convert path).
- **Headers and footers** now included in `to_markdown` and `to_ir`
  (previously silently dropped).
- **Embedded fonts** under `/word/fonts/` exposed on
  `DocxDocument.embedded_fonts`. `strip_embedded_font_filename` recovers
  the original face name from `font_<n>_<face>.<ext>` (fixes greedy
  alphabetic-trim regression where `TeXGyreTermesX-` was returned
  instead of `TeXGyreTermesX-Regular`).
- **`parse_drawing` decomposed** into focused recursive helpers
  (`parse_inline_or_anchor_body`, `parse_anchor_position`,
  `parse_shape_properties`, etc.) for readability.
- **Run-level `<w:rFonts w:ascii>` plumbed into `TextSpan.font_name`**;
  `<w:cols>` propagated to `Section.columns`.

### PPTX

- **Pagination**: each slide forces a `SectionBreakType::NextPage` so two
  slides never share a rendered page.
- **Real Title+Body slide layout** emitted by the writer instead of a blank
  layout, so PowerPoint shows placeholder hints in edit mode.
- **Slide background**: `<p:cSld><p:bg><p:bgPr><a:solidFill><a:srgbClr>`
  parsed into `Slide.background_rgb` and propagated to `Section.background_rgb`.
- **Positioned text boxes**: shapes with explicit `<a:xfrm>` coordinates
  wrap their content in `Element::TextBox` so downstream renderers can
  place them at absolute EMU coordinates. Zero-size shapes skip the wrapper.
- **Slide size → page setup**: `<p:sldSz cx=… cy=…>` propagated to each
  section's `PageSetup`.
- **Run font sizes preserved** via new `TextRun.font_size_hundredths_pt`
  (parsed from `<a:rPr sz="…"/>`).
- **Run colour preserved** via new `TextRun.color_rgb: Option<[u8; 3]>`
  parsed from `<a:rPr><a:solidFill><a:srgbClr val="RRGGBB"/></a:solidFill>`
  and propagated to `TextSpan.color` in IR. The parser tracks an
  `in_solid_fill` flag so sibling effects (e.g. `<a:hl><a:srgbClr/>`
  for hyperlink colour) don't leak into the run's own fill; non-sRGB
  fills (gradient, scheme colour) fall back to `None`.
- **Paragraph alignment** parsed from `<a:pPr algn="…"/>` (all five
  variants: `l` / `ctr` / `r` / `just` / `dist`) into
  `TextParagraph.alignment`. **Space-before** parsed from
  `<a:spcBef><a:spcPts val=…/>`.
- **Title alignment propagation**: `find_title` returns text + first
  paragraph's alignment, seeding both `Section.title` and the synthesised
  level-2 Heading's alignment.
- **Picture shapes** now carry `embed_rid`, `data`, and `format`
  (resolved via a pre-built media map at parse time, so the parallel
  slide parser doesn't need the OPC reader).
- **Font embedding** under `/ppt/fonts/`.
- **Structured chart text extraction**: `<c:chart>` parts parsed into
  per-chart text blocks rendered as `## Chart N` in markdown / search /
  PDF without needing a graphical chart renderer.
- **Compaction**: consecutive H1/H2 cover-page headings fold into one
  slide instead of fragmenting; long XLSX paragraphs split across cells
  to respect ~32k char-per-cell limits.
- **Slide cap**: writer caps at ~250 slides (PowerPoint's hard limit).

### XLSX

- **Per-worksheet `page_setup`** round-trips via `<pageMargins>` (inches)
  and `<pageSetup>` (paperWidth/paperHeight with mm/cm/in suffix or
  `paperSize` enum 1–13). New `Worksheet.page_setup`.
- **`numfmt` module** (`crate::xlsx::numfmt`): built-in IDs 0–44 (general,
  fixed, commas, percent, currency, scientific, accounting) and a
  simplified custom format-string parser (multi-section, `[Red]` color
  directives stripped, currency prefix from `[$€-407]`, quoted literal
  suffix, percent and thousands separators). Applied to numeric cells
  during `format_cell_value` and `write_cell_value_fast`.
- **Font sizes** preserved through IR; long-text single-column sheets
  emit as paragraphs instead of a tall 1-column GFM table.
- **Unique worksheet names** in `ir_to_xlsx` (duplicates suffixed with
  `_2`, `_3`, …).
- **Drawings**: `xl/drawings/drawingN.xml` parsed into
  `Worksheet.images` (`WorksheetPicture` with EMU coords + bytes) and
  `Worksheet.text_shapes` (`WorksheetTextShape` for layout-mode text
  boxes from `to_xlsx_bytes_layout`).
- **Embedded fonts** under `/xl/fonts/`.

### IR enrichment

- **New types**: `Shape` (vector shape anchored at absolute EMU coords),
  `ShapeGeom` (`Line`, `Rect`), `FramePosition` (twip-anchored frame).
- **`Heading`** gains `frame_position` + `alignment`.
- **`Section`** gains `background_rgb`.
- **`ParagraphAlignment`** gains the `Distribute` variant.
- **`Element::Shape(Shape)`** variant for vector shapes.
- **New helpers**: `first_inline_font_size_pt`, `inline_to_element_block`,
  `build_nested_list` (flat / 2-level / 3-level recursion).
- **Centralized defaults** in `ir_render::block_default`: ThematicBreak
  renders as `"---"` / `<hr />`; PageBreak / ColumnBreak / Shape are
  invisible in flow; TextBox / Footnote / Endnote recursively render
  children. Adding a new `Element` variant forces a compile error
  in `block_default::default_plain` instead of silent fallthrough.

### Core

- **`crate::core::core_properties`**: shared `docProps/core.xml` generator
  used by all three writers. Emits `dc:title`, `dc:creator`, `dc:subject`,
  `dc:description`, `cp:keywords`, `dcterms:created`, `dcterms:modified`
  from the IR's `Metadata`. Empty fields are omitted entirely.
- **`crate::core::embedded_fonts`**: unified font-embedding helper
  (`write_embedded_fonts`, `sanitize_font_filename`). All three formats
  share the layout `<prefix>font_<n>_<safe_name>.ttf`.
- **`HalfPoint::from_word_sz` / `from_drawingml_sz` / `to_drawingml_sz` /
  `from_points_rounded`**: cross-format font-size invariants
  (DrawingML hundredths-of-a-point vs WML half-points).

### Dependencies

- **`quick-xml` 0.37 → 0.40**: upstream removed `BytesText::unescape()`
  and deprecated `Attribute::unescape_value()` (its replacement
  `normalized_value()` has different semantics — no entity
  unescaping). Migration added two helpers in `core::xml`:
  `unescape_text(BytesText) -> Result<String>` (used by 6 call sites)
  and `unescape_attr_value` (used by 6 call sites, with
  `#[allow(deprecated)]` localised to the helper so call sites stay
  deprecation-free). 535 / 535 tests still pass; clippy clean.
- **`koffi` 2.16.1 → 2.16.2** in `js/` (patch bump).

### Documentation

- **CLI / MCP crate-level docs**: `office_oxide_cli` and
  `office_oxide_mcp` previously opened with `mod commands;` /
  `mod protocol;` and had no crate-level rustdoc. Added a short
  `//!` block plus `#![warn(missing_docs)]` so future items in
  either binary stay documented.
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D missing_docs" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
  --features parallel,mmap` now passes with zero errors.

### Tests

- **+98 unit tests** across the modules touched in this release:
  `core::embedded_fonts`, `core::core_properties`, `core::units`,
  `xlsx::numfmt`, `xlsx::worksheet`, `docx::formatting`, `docx::mod`,
  `pptx::slide`, `ir`, `ir_render`.
- **535 / 535 tests pass** across default, `--features parallel`,
  `--features mmap`, and `--features parallel,mmap` builds.
- `cargo fmt` clean. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean.

### Bindings

- **Python wheel** (maturin, PyO3 0.28) builds cleanly and exposes
  `Document`, `EditableDocument`, `XlsxWriter`, `PptxWriter`,
  `OfficeOxideError`, `create_from_markdown`, `extract_text`,
  `to_markdown`, `to_html`, `version`.
- **WASM** package (`wasm-pack build --target web/node/bundler`) builds
  cleanly with `--features wasm`.
- **C#** package bumped to 0.1.2 (csproj only — no API changes).

[0.1.2]: https://github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.2

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-30

> Richer IR type system, DOCX writer output, improved PPTX/XLSX IR renderers, and writer APIs in all language bindings

### IR — extended type system

- **`TextSpan`** gains nine typography fields: `font_name`, `font_size_half_pt`,
  `color`, `highlight`, `underline` (`UnderlineStyle` enum), `vertical_align`
  (`VerticalAlign`: Superscript / Subscript / Baseline), `all_caps`,
  `small_caps`, `char_spacing_half_pt`.
- **`Paragraph`** gains twelve layout fields: `alignment` (`ParagraphAlignment`:
  Left / Center / Right / Justify / Distribute), `indent_left_twips`,
  `indent_right_twips`, `first_line_indent_twips`, `space_before_twips`,
  `space_after_twips`, `line_spacing` (`LineSpacing`: Auto / Multiple / Exact /
  AtLeast), `background_color`, `border` (`ParagraphBorder`), `keep_with_next`,
  `keep_together`, `page_break_before`, `outline_level`.
- **`Table`** gains `width_twips`, `column_widths_twips`, `border`
  (`TableBorder`), `alignment` (`TableAlignment`), `indent_left_twips`,
  `cell_padding_twips`, `caption`.
- **`TableRow`** gains `height_twips`, `allow_break`, `repeat_as_header`.
- **`TableCell`** gains `background_color`, `border`, `vertical_align`
  (`CellVerticalAlign`), `text_align`, `width_twips`, `padding` (`CellPadding`),
  `text_direction` (`TextDirection`).
- **`Image`** gains `data`, `format` (`ImageFormat`), `pixel_width`,
  `pixel_height`, `display_width_emu`, `display_height_emu`, `decorative`,
  `positioning` (`ImagePositioning`: Inline or Floating with `FloatingImage`).
- **`Section`** gains `page_setup` (`PageSetup`), `columns` (`ColumnLayout`),
  `break_type` (`SectionBreakType`), and six header/footer slots
  (`header`, `footer`, `first_page_header`, `first_page_footer`,
  `even_page_header`, `even_page_footer`).
- **`Metadata`** gains `author`, `subject`, `keywords`, `created`, `modified`,
  `description` (written to `docProps/core.xml`).
- **New `Element` variants**: `TextBox`, `PageBreak`, `ColumnBreak`,
  `Footnote(Note)`, `Endnote(Note)`, `CodeBlock`.
- **`List`** gains `start_number`, `style` (`ListStyle`), `level`.
  `ListItem.content` promoted from `Vec<InlineContent>` to `Vec<Element>`
  to allow block-level content (tables, images) inside list items.
- **`InlineContent`** gains `FootnoteRef` and `EndnoteRef` variants.
- **New supporting types**: `BorderLine`, `TableBorder`, `ParagraphBorder`,
  `CellPadding`, `FloatingImage`, `HeaderFooter`, `TextBox`, `Note`,
  `FootnoteRef`, `CodeBlock`, `PageSetup`, `ColumnLayout`.
- **New enums**: `UnderlineStyle`, `ParagraphAlignment`, `LineSpacing`,
  `BorderStyle`, `CellVerticalAlign`, `TableAlignment`, `TextDirection`,
  `ImageFormat`, `ImagePositioning`, `SectionBreakType`, `VerticalAlign`,
  `FloatAnchor`, `TextWrap`, `ListStyle`.
- All new fields are `Option<_>` or default to `false`/`None` — fully
  backwards compatible; existing callers require only `..Default::default()`
  on struct literals.

### DocxWriter — OOXML emission for all new fields

- **Run properties**: `<w:rFonts>`, `<w:sz>`/`<w:szCs>`, `<w:color>`,
  `<w:shd>` (highlight), `<w:u>`, `<w:vertAlign>`, `<w:caps>`,
  `<w:smallCaps>`, `<w:spacing>` (character spacing).
- **Paragraph properties**: `<w:jc>`, `<w:ind>`, `<w:spacing>` (before/after/
  line), `<w:pBdr>`, `<w:shd>`, `<w:keepNext>`, `<w:keepLines>`,
  `<w:pageBreakBefore>`, `<w:outlineLvl>`.
- **Table**: `<w:tblW>`, `<w:tblInd>`, `<w:tblBorders>`, `<w:jc>` (table),
  `<w:tblCellMar>`, `<w:tblGrid>`/`<w:gridCol>`.
- **Table row**: `<w:trHeight>`, `<w:tblHeader>`, `<w:cantSplit>`.
- **Table cell**: `<w:tcW>`, `<w:gridSpan>`, `<w:vMerge>`, `<w:shd>` (cell),
  `<w:tcBorders>`, `<w:vAlign>`, `<w:textDirection>`, `<w:tcMar>` (per-edge
  padding), cell-level `text_align` propagated to contained paragraphs.
- **Table caption**: emitted as a `Caption`-styled paragraph before `<w:tbl>`.
- **Images**: inline `<wp:inline>` and floating `<wp:anchor>` with
  `<wp:wrapSquare>` / `<wp:wrapTight>` / `<wp:wrapThrough>` /
  `<wp:wrapTopAndBottom>` / `<wp:wrapNone>`.
- **Text boxes**: `<wp:anchor>` + `<wps:txbx>` + `<w:txbxContent>`.
- **Sections**: `<w:sectPr>` with `<w:pgSz>`, `<w:pgMar>`, `<w:cols>` (uniform
  and per-column widths with separator rule), `<w:type>` (Continuous / NextPage
  / EvenPage / OddPage). Header/footer parts written to `/word/header*.xml` and
  `/word/footer*.xml` with correct relationship entries.
- **Footnotes / endnotes**: `/word/footnotes.xml` and `/word/endnotes.xml`
  parts; inline `<w:footnoteReference>` / `<w:endnoteReference>` runs with
  `FootnoteReference` / `EndnoteReference` character styles.
- **`{PAGE}` / `{NUMPAGES}` sentinels** in header/footer text spans emitted as
  `<w:fldChar>` / `<w:instrText>` field runs.
- **Page break**: `<w:br w:type="page">`. **Column break**: `<w:br
  w:type="column">`.
- **Code blocks**: `Code`-styled paragraph with preserved whitespace and
  line breaks.
- **Lists**: `<w:numFmt>` driven by `ListStyle`; `<w:startOverride>` for
  non-1 `start_number`; block-level item content (tables, images) written
  alongside the numbered paragraph.
- **Metadata**: `author`, `subject`, `keywords`, `description`, `created`,
  `modified` written to `docProps/core.xml` as Dublin Core properties.

### PPTX IR renderer — `ir_to_pptx`

- **Rich text runs**: paragraphs and headings now emit styled `<a:r>` runs via
  `add_rich_text()` — bold, italic, font size, color, and font name from
  `TextSpan` are all preserved. Previously all formatting was stripped.
- **Table elements**: rendered as tab-separated cell text (rows joined with `\n`)
  instead of being silently dropped.
- **Image elements**: embedded as native PPTX media via the new
  `SlideData::add_image()` API — writes a `<p:pic>` shape with `<p:blipFill>`
  and an OPC media part. PNG, JPEG, and GIF are supported.
- **CodeBlock elements**: rendered with Courier New font run instead of being
  silently dropped.
- **Slide dimensions**: first `Section.page_setup` is now forwarded to
  `PptxWriter::set_presentation_size()` (1 twip = 914 400/1 440 EMU), fixing
  clipped output for landscape A4 and other non-16:9 documents.
- **New `PptxWriter::set_presentation_size(cx, cy)`** method; emits `<p:sldSz>`
  with the correct EMU values instead of always writing the 16:9 default.

### XLSX IR renderer — `ir_to_xlsx`

- **Header row styling**: rows with `TableRow.is_header = true` are now written
  with bold weight and a grey (`D3D3D3`) background via `set_cell_styled()`.
  `TableCell.background_color` overrides the default grey when set.
- **Cell background color**: non-header cells with `TableCell.background_color`
  set now get a solid fill style applied.
- **Column widths**: `Table.column_widths_twips` is now converted to Excel
  character-width units (`twips × 96 / (1440 × 7)`, clamped 3–80) and written
  via `set_column_width()`.
- **Merged cells**: `TableCell.col_span` and `row_span` > 1 now emit a
  `<mergeCells>/<mergeCell ref="…"/>` block in the worksheet XML instead of
  being ignored.
- **New `SheetData::merge_cells(row, col, row_span, col_span)`** method; inserts
  `<mergeCells>` between `</sheetData>` and `</worksheet>`.
- Row cursor tracks absolute position across all elements in a section, so
  paragraphs and headings interleaved with tables land in the correct rows.

### Writer APIs — all language bindings

`XlsxWriter` and `PptxWriter` (previously Rust-only) are now callable from
every binding layer via a new index-based C FFI surface:

**New C FFI symbols** (`include/office_oxide_c/office_oxide.h`):

- `office_xlsx_writer_new/free`, `office_xlsx_writer_add_sheet` (returns sheet
  index), `office_xlsx_sheet_set_cell`, `office_xlsx_sheet_set_cell_styled`
  (bold + hex background), `office_xlsx_sheet_merge_cells`,
  `office_xlsx_sheet_set_column_width`, `office_xlsx_writer_save`,
  `office_xlsx_writer_to_bytes`
- `office_pptx_writer_new/free`, `office_pptx_writer_set_presentation_size`,
  `office_pptx_writer_add_slide` (returns slide index),
  `office_pptx_slide_set_title`, `office_pptx_slide_add_text`,
  `office_pptx_slide_add_image` (PNG/JPEG/GIF bytes + EMU geometry),
  `office_pptx_writer_save`, `office_pptx_writer_to_bytes`

**Go** — `XlsxWriter` and `PptxWriter` structs with CGo wrappers and
`runtime.SetFinalizer` for safe GC.

**C# / .NET** — new `OfficeOxide.XlsxWriter` and `OfficeOxide.PptxWriter`
classes (`IDisposable`); P/Invoke declarations added to `NativeMethods`.

**Node.js** — `XlsxWriter` and `PptxWriter` ESM + CJS classes; koffi
function prototypes; TypeScript `ImageFormat` type and class declarations.

**Python** — `XlsxWriter` and `PyO3PptxWriter` PyO3 classes calling Rust
directly (no C FFI round-trip); exported from `office_oxide` with full type
stubs in `_native.pyi`.

### Bug fixes

- `TableCell.padding` (`CellPadding`) was defined in the IR but silently
  dropped by the writer; now emits `<w:tcMar>` with per-edge twip values.
- `TableCell.text_align` was defined in the IR but silently dropped; now
  propagated to contained paragraphs (respects pre-existing paragraph
  alignment, so explicit paragraph alignment is never overwritten).
- `Table.caption` was defined in the IR but silently dropped; now emitted
  as a `Caption`-styled paragraph immediately before the table.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-27

> Initial public release

### Cross-language bindings

- **Rust core** (`office_oxide` on crates.io): unified `Document` handle for
  all six formats, `EditableDocument` for DOCX/XLSX/PPTX editing, format-
  agnostic `DocumentIR`.
- **Python** (`office-oxide` on PyPI): context-manager `Document` /
  `EditableDocument`, `os.PathLike` support, complete type stubs in
  `_native.pyi` (`Literal` format names, `_Path` alias).
- **Go** (`github.com/yfedoseev/office_oxide/go`): CGo wrapper over the C FFI
  with idiomatic `Open` / `Close` / error-return API, `go/cmd/install` helper
  that fetches the matching native archive and prints the
  `CGO_CFLAGS` / `CGO_LDFLAGS` to export.
- **C# / .NET** (`OfficeOxide` on NuGet): `LibraryImport` P/Invoke,
  `IDisposable`, `async/await`, `IsAotCompatible=true`, `IsTrimmable=true`.
  Four `SetCell` overloads + `SetCellEmpty`. Net 8 and net 10 target
  frameworks.
- **Node.js native** (`office-oxide` on npm): [koffi](https://koffi.dev)-based,
  no node-gyp, ESM + CJS entry points with an `exports` map, TypeScript
  definitions, `Symbol.dispose` support, platform prebuilds staged into
  `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>/`.
- **WASM** (`office-oxide-wasm` on npm): three sub-path exports — default
  ESM for bundlers, `office-oxide-wasm/node` for CJS, `office-oxide-wasm/web`
  for native-ESM browser imports. TypeScript definitions shipped.
- **C FFI** (`include/office_oxide_c/office_oxide.h`): stable
  `office_document_*` / `office_editable_*` surface with out-param error
  codes and explicit memory ownership. Exported from the cdylib + staticlib;
  the substrate that Go, C#, and Node-native link against.

### Tooling

- **CLI** (`office-oxide` binary): `text`, `markdown`, `html`, `info`, `ir`
  subcommands.
- **MCP server** (`office-oxide-mcp` binary): `extract` and `info` tools
  over JSON-RPC 2.0 / stdio.

### Performance

- Up to 100× faster than `python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `python-pptx`, `xlrd`.
- Beats `calamine` on XLSX and all Rust / Python alternatives on .xls.
- **100% pass rate on valid Office files** (6,062-file corpus: LibreOffice,
  Apache POI, python-pptx, python-docx, Pandoc, etc.). All 97 non-passing
  files are invalid inputs — corrupted ZIPs, missing required parts, malformed
  XML, or non-Office files with Office extensions.

### Documentation & examples

- Per-language getting-started guides in [`docs/`](docs/): Rust, Python,
  Go, C#, JavaScript (native), WASM, and C / raw FFI.
- Per-binding READMEs in [`python/`](python/README.md), [`go/`](go/README.md),
  [`csharp/OfficeOxide/`](csharp/OfficeOxide/README.md),
  [`js/`](js/README.md), [`wasm-pkg/`](wasm-pkg/README.md).
- Identical `extract` / `replace` / `read_xlsx` demos per language under
  [`examples/`](examples/).

### Release CI

- Version parity across `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `wasm-pkg/package.json`, `js/package.json`, and
  `csharp/OfficeOxide/OfficeOxide.csproj`.
- 6-target native-lib build matrix producing `.tar.gz` / `.zip` archives
  with the shared library, static archive, and public header.
- 3-target WASM build (bundler / nodejs / web) with per-target module-type
  hints so Node + bundlers + browsers each load the right code.
- NuGet packaging with `runtimes/<rid>/native/` prebuilts, Node
  `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>/` staging, and a `go/v*` module tag for the
  Go module proxy.

### Robustness

- OOXML Strict namespace support via dual-namespace matching
  (`strict_alternate()`) and relationship-type normalization
- Case-insensitive ZIP entry lookup with backslash path normalization
- Namespace-agnostic attribute lookup (`optional_prefixed_attr_str()`)
  for `d3p1:id` and similar
- Percent-encoding decoding in `PartName::new()`
- CRC checksum tolerance in `read_zip_entry()` (accepts data on mismatch)
- Tolerant numeric parsing: `parse_numeric()` strips unit suffixes,
  handles decimals
- Shared-string DoS cap: `MAX_CELL_STRING_LEN = 32_768` in `xlsx`
- Optional parts (`numbering.xml`, theme) degrade gracefully on read
  errors
- XLSX border aliases: `start`/`end` mapped to `left`/`right` for Strict
  OOXML

### Validation

- **98.4% pass rate on a 6,062-file corpus** (5,965 / 6,062) across 11
  open-source test suites (LibreOffice Core, Apache POI, Open XML SDK,
  ClosedXML, Pandoc, python-docx, python-pptx, Apache Tika, calamine,
  openpreserve, oletools)
- Zero failures on legitimate Word 97+ / Excel 97+ / PowerPoint 97+
  files — all 97 non-passing files are invalid inputs: 43 invalid
  ZIP/CFB archives, 21 missing required parts, 18 malformed XML, and
  15 non-Office files (WordPerfect, pre-OLE2 Excel 3/4) misnamed with
  Office extensions
- See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for per-format timings and the
  full failure breakdown
