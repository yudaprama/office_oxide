# Revert-check: prove that the tests a branch adds actually cover the
# production code it adds.
#
# A test that still passes with its own production hunk reverted is testing
# nothing. This has shipped twice: once a guard whose unit test hand-built the
# struct instead of going through the parser, and once nine of thirty-two new
# tests that passed with their production hunk reverted — one of them
# asserting `.all()` over a vector that is always empty, which is vacuously
# true under any implementation, including one that does nothing.
#
# How it works: revert this branch's changes to `src/` (keeping the new tests),
# then run the test suite. It MUST fail. If it passes, the new tests do not
# exercise the new code.
#
# Usage:  scripts/revert-check.sh [base-ref]      (default: origin/main)
